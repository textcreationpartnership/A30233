            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Axiome</hi> 1. <hi>LOGICK</hi> is the Art of making of Inſtruments

                  <p>There is yet an Homonymie, or Ambiguity of <hi>meaning,</hi> lies hid in this Word <hi>Logick;</hi> for it is uſed either for a natural Faculty of Diſcourſe, as when Perſons of little Learning or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are ſaid to uſe Logick or Diſcourſe, when af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Logick</hi> in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd Definition, left any one ſhou'd miſtake, is taken for a Habit, which is as it were the End to which Precepts are deſign'd.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. A Theme is whatſoever may be propos'd to the Underſtanding to be known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. Themes are either Simple or Compoſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Themes Simple are thoſe which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood without a Compoſition or Complexion of Notions, as <hi>Man, runs, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56895:14"/>
                  <p>A Complexion of Notions is nothing elſe but an Affirmation or Negation in the Underſtanding or Speech. And by this means are Themes Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be diſcern'd from Complex, and not by the Multitude or Compoſition of Words: For a Simple Theme is often expreſs'd by a Compound Word, as <hi>Common-Wealth, Goat-Hart, &amp;c.</hi> Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alſo by many Words, as, <hi>Love of Parents to'ards their Children.</hi> Sometimes in one, and that a Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Word, you have a Theme Complex; as when I ſay in <hi>Latin, pluit, ningit, itur, ſtatur;</hi> that is, <hi>it Rains, it Snows, we go, we ſtand, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. A Theme Simple is either Univerſal or Singular.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. A Univerſal is that which is apt of its own Nature to be predicated of many things, as <hi>Man, Horſe, Plant, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Univerſal is ſaid to be predicated of many things either actually Exiſting, or at leaſt ſuch as may Exiſt. So <hi>Man</hi> was a Univerſal when <hi>Adam</hi> only was in being; becauſe <hi>Man</hi> was not only apt of its own Nature to be ſaid of <hi>Adam,</hi> but of all Men that were to be born. So altho' the <hi>Sun</hi> be really but One, it may yet, that is, the Term <hi>Sun,</hi> be call'd a <hi>Univerſal,</hi> becauſe many <hi>Suns</hi> may be made of the ſame Nature with this of ours.</p>
                  <p>A Univerſal is ſaid to be of its own Nature apt to be predicated; leſt any one ſhou'd think Homonymous Words, or Words given to many Singulars of the ſame <hi>Species;</hi> as, When many Men are call'd <hi>Peter,</hi> to be Univerſals: For Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymous, as Homonymous, are predicated of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as to their Names only, not Definitions, or, as to their own Natures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. The Singular is that which of its own Nature, is apt to be predicated only of One.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. Singulars are alſo call'd Individuals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not diviſible into more of the ſame Name and Nature: So <hi>Plato,</hi> altho' he may, be divided
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56895:15"/>into Body and Soul, Head, Belly, Breaſt, Feet, and his other Members; yet cannot he be divided into more <hi>Plato's.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. Individuals are either Determin'd or Vague; that is, Uncertain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. Individuals are determin'd four ways: firſt, by their Proper Names, as <hi>Alexander, Buce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalus, &amp;c.</hi> And ſecondly, by a Common Name taken by way of Excellency, for their Proper; as <hi>Philoſopher</hi> for <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> Thirdly, by a demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Pronoun, as <hi>this Man.</hi> Fourthly <hi>Periphraſis,</hi> as <hi>The Apoſtle of the Gentiles,</hi> for <hi>St. Paul.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. An Uncertain Undividual is that which is pronounc'd with a particular Pronoun; as <hi>Some Man, a certain Man, &amp;c.</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Of which the one is of Subſtances, the reſt of Accidents. This Number is taken from the diverſity of Queſtions which may be made concerning the firſt and individual Subſtances, as appears from the very Appellations of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. In theſe Ten are contain'd all things which can be praedicated of any Subject; others directly, others indirectly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. That which directly, requires theſe Five Conditions.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. It muſt be a <hi>Finite Being.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this Condition God is excluded out of the <hi>Categories:</hi> For altho' God be a Subſtance, yet is he not put in the <hi>Category</hi> of Subſtance; for thoſe things which are directly plac'd in this <hi>Category,</hi> not only ſubſiſt of themſelves, but are ſubject al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to Accidents, as we ſhall hereafter make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, which to think of God were impious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the <hi>Genus,</hi> properly ſo call'd, of thoſe things which are directly plac'd in the ſame <hi>Category,</hi> muſt be the ſame: But neither Subſtance, nor any thing elſe, can be the <hi>Genus</hi> properly ſo call'd of things Finite and Infinite: God therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infinite cannot be directly contain'd under the <hi>Genus</hi> of Finite Subſtances. Yet is he aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally revok'd to this <hi>Category.</hi> For Subſtance is the <hi>Genus</hi> aequivocal both of God and Finite Subſtances.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. <hi>True and Poſitive.</hi> To a true Being <hi>firſt</hi> are oppos'd Beings of Reaſon, as <hi>Genus, Species, &amp;c.</hi> which are by no means in <hi>Categories.</hi> 2dly. The fictitious or feign'd, as <hi>Chimaera, Centaure, &amp;c.</hi> which are referr'd to <hi>Categories</hi> Hypothetically, or by way of Suppoſition: For if a <hi>Centaure</hi> were that which it is feign'd to be, it wou'd really be put in the <hi>Category</hi> of Subſtances. 3dly. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, or, as they commonly ſay, Intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, as the <hi>Rain-bow, Colours appearing, Species's</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56895:16"/>
                     <hi>Spectres</hi> of the Senſes and Underſtanding, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things whoſe Eſſence only conſiſts in their Apparition. Theſe things belong to <hi>Categories,</hi> becauſe of their Similitude; for they are the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of true things. Hither alſo referr <hi>painted Images</hi> of true things as they are Images. To <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Beings</hi> are oppos'd Privations; as <hi>Blindneſs, Darkneſs, &amp;c.</hi> which are reduc'd to <hi>Categories</hi> by their oppoſite Habits.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>Compleat and Perfect.</hi> By this Condition are excluded, 1ſt. The Principles or Beginnings of things, as <hi>Unity, Moment, &amp;c.</hi> 2dly. All Parts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. 3dly. Imperfect Beings, and, as they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, in <hi>fieri</hi> or Action, as an <hi>Embrio, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c.</hi> 4thly. Modes and Compliments of other Beings. Theſe are all reduc'd to the <hi>Categories</hi> by Concomitancy, except Differences, which altho' Parts of Species are ſaid to belong collaterally, becauſe they adhere collaterally or ſideways to their Species's.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. <hi>One by it ſelf.</hi> By this Condition are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, 1ſt. Complex Beings, as <hi>A Man Runs.</hi> 2dly. Concrete, as <hi>White, Juſt.</hi> 3dly. Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, as <hi>an Heap, an Army.</hi> Theſe are all reduc'd by Accident to the <hi>Categories</hi> of thoſe things of which they are compos'd.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>Univerſal.</hi> By this means are rejected, 1ſt. Tranſcendents, as, <hi>Being, Thing, One, True, Good,</hi> which by their Community exceed all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Categories,</hi> and then Singulars, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe naturally they are not praedicated, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected only, are not in <hi>Categories,</hi> but underneath them, as it were a Baſis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. The firſt and principal Uſe of <hi>Categories</hi> is, that things which are of their own Nature, infinite, being reduc'd to certain Forms or Claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, our Mind may ſurvey them at one View or Glimpſe, and obſerve how this or that may be compared with any other thing.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56895:16"/>
                  <p>This Uſe confers much not only to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Logick, but of all Philoſophy, and other Diſciplines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. Out of this firſt Uſe three more do ariſe. For, <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Diſpoſitions of things in <hi>Categories</hi> conferr much to the delivering of the Affections of Simple Themes, and ſecond Notions, which are to be form'd out of the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly. From the ſame Diſpoſition it appears, what of its own Nature is fit to be ſubjected, what prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly. There is no greater Aſſiſtance towards defining, dividing, diſpoſing, I may add alſo Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation, than an Order of <hi>Categories</hi> well diſpos'd.</p>
                  <p>From whence it appears how much they are miſtaken who would cut off from Logick this ſo uſeful and neceſſary part; which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo much eſteem'd, that he wrote a particular Book of it, if yet that Book be <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s; and has again incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it in his <hi>Metaphyſicks;</hi> and moreover in his <hi>Logical Precepts,</hi> made mention of it very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the firſt Book of his <hi>Topicks,</hi> alſo <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. commending it not obſcurely for its Utility: The like to which <hi>Porphiry</hi> has done in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A Subſtance hath no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>That is, not by reaſon of their Subſtance but Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; as <hi>Heat and Cold, Drineſs and Moiſture, Weight and Lightneſs, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>That is, is not intended or remitted. This is underſtood of one and the ſame Subſtance, which in ſucceſſion of Time, cannot be made more a Subſtance in Genus or Species than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> cannot be made more a Subſtance, or more a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Stone</hi> than they were before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> One and the ſame Numerical Subſtance receives Contraries.</p>
                  <p>That is, A Subſtance, altho' it has receiv'd Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, remains ſtill the ſame Subſtance as it was before. So cold Water, altho' by a Mutation it becomes hot, yet it is not another Subſtance, but remains ſtill of the ſame Nature as it was before.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. AN Accident is a being inherent in a Subſtance.</p>
                  <p>That is, ſo as that it can no ways exiſt ſeparate from it. Hence follows, that,</p>
                  <p n="1">I. An Accident cannot exiſt without a Subject.</p>

                  <p>In which three things are attributed to Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity: 1ſt. <hi>To have Parts;</hi> and therefore God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Human Souls, Points, Unites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Quantity, nor Parts of Quantity, becauſe not conſiſting of Parts. 2dly. <hi>To have Part out of Part;</hi> that is, to have Parts not in Eſſence only, but alſo in Scite and Space different: For there are two kinds of Parts: Some together, and mutually penetrating each the other; as <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form:</hi> Others not, but are different in Scite, as <hi>Head, Breaſt, Body, Limbs, &amp;c.</hi> And ſuch as theſe are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in Quantity. I ſaid <hi>Part out of Part,</hi> rather than <hi>Parts,</hi> becauſe Quantity may have but two, as in the Number <hi>Two.</hi> 3dly. To have Part out of Part <hi>by it ſelf.</hi> Becauſe a Corporeal Subſtance, and every Accident inhering in it, hath Part out of Part; but by reaſon of Quantity, not by it ſelf: But, Quantity, as <hi>Magnitude,</hi> and <hi>Number,</hi> and <hi>Time,</hi> have Part out of Part, and that <hi>by themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56895:18"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Quantity is either continu'd or diſcrete.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. Continu'd is that whoſe Parts are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected together by one common Term.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. Diſcrete, whoſe Parts are not connected by one common Term, and is nothing elſe but Number.</p>
                  <p>Number uſes to be divided into Number num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, and Number numbred. Number number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is nothing elſe but Number in the Abſtract, or a Collection of Unities it ſelf, as <hi>two, three, &amp;c.</hi> Number numbred is only Number in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, or the things that are to be numbred, as <hi>Two Men, Three Horſes, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. Magnitude is a Permanent Quantity.</p>

But the Parts of Magnitude exiſt together, and each of them may be ſhewn where it is ſeated, and to which of the other Parts it coheres. But the Parts of Time have no Scite, becauſe they conſiſt in a continual Flux. Nor have the Parts of Number any Poſition, becauſe they are no where ſeated, neither do they cohere.

                  <p>A Line is ſaid to be one way diviſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a meer Length without Breadth or Depth, as <hi>an Ell, a Furlong, a Mile.</hi> A Superficies two, becauſe Length and Breadth, without Depth; as <hi>an Acre of Land.</hi> A Body three; that is, into Length, Breadth, and Thickneſs; as <hi>a Cube, a Sphere, &amp;c.</hi> For altho' a Body elſewhere ſignifies a Subſtance compos'd of Matter and Form, yet in this place it denotes nothing elſe, but Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude or Quantity every way diviſible in the Abſtract.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we yet to imagine a Longitude is to be found without Breadth, or a Breadth without Thickneſs: For theſe things are not really ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but diſtinct only in the Mind.</p>

                  <p>That is, By it ſelf: For if Quantity be ſaid to be contrary to Quantity, it is becauſe of its Quality adjoined; as when the Winter Seaſon is ſaid to be contrary to the Summer, becauſe of the Cold and Heat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 20. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Quantity receives not more and leſs.</p>
                  <p>That is, Is not intended or remitted; but it is extended and contracted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Things are ſaid by Quantity to be equal or unequal.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. For Equality and Inequality are Relations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to things on the account of Quantity.</p>

                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:56895:19"/>II. Hitherto of <hi>Quantity,</hi> properly ſo call'd, which, becauſe contain'd in this one <hi>Category,</hi> is wont to be call'd <hi>Praedicamental.</hi> There is alſo another Quantity improperly ſo call'd, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in the Extenſion of Parts, but in the Perfection and Vertue of every thing.

                     </gap>, differs from the third Species of Quality, becauſe not obvious to the Senſes, as that is. The ſame differs from Habit, both becauſe it is from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Habit elſewhere, and becauſe it only renders the Subject fit to do or ſuffer. Whereas Habit
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56895:21"/>alſo renders a Subject propenſe, and that to do expeditiouſly and with facility.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. Natural Power is alſo divided by <hi>Ariſtotle, Book</hi> IV. of his <hi>Metaphyſicks, Chap.</hi> 12. into Active and Paſſive. Both are defin'd in this manner: <hi>Some Power is ſaid to be a Principle of Motion or Mutation in another, as it is another; ſome from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as another:</hi> That is <hi>Active;</hi> This <hi>Paſſive.</hi> For Example; <hi>The Power of Generating, moving from Place to Place, Heating, Building, &amp;c.</hi> is an <hi>Active</hi> Power; But <hi>Softneſs</hi> is a <hi>Paſſive</hi> Power to Cutting or Section.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. §. To theſe may be added a certain mixt Power, which, becauſe a Principle of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in it ſelf, is at the ſame time <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive;</hi> as, <hi>the Intellect,</hi> and <hi>Will, &amp;c.</hi> From this Power flow Actions immanent; as, <hi>to Underſtand,</hi> and <hi>Will, &amp;c.</hi> From <hi>Active,</hi> Tranſient, or paſſing out.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. §. Beſides which, Natural Power is either, <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Second.</hi> The firſt is that which flows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Form of the Subject. The <hi>Second,</hi> a diſpoſition only of the Matter, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratous of the Organs, with which the former exerciſes its Functions. For Example: <hi>The Faculty of Seeing, as it flows from a Senſitive Soul, is the</hi> Firſt <hi>Power; but as it conſiſts in the Structure and Temperation of the Eye, it is the</hi> Second. The <hi>firſt</hi> Power cannot be taken away from any Subject, or diminiſh'd. The <hi>ſecond</hi> be both taken away, and diminiſh'd: When therefore Impotency is ſaid to be diminiſh'd Power, the <hi>ſecond</hi> Power is to be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. §.

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Relateds according to their Names are abſolute things, which include or connote a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore not in Eſſence but in Name on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are referred to ſomething elſe.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. Relateds according to their Eſſence, are thoſe things in whom <hi>to be,</hi> and to have reſpect to ſomething elſe, is the <hi>ſame thing;</hi> or whoſe Eſſence is wholly placed in the Reſpect they bear to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Relateds in Reſpect of their Names, and Relateds in Reſpect of their Eſſence, differ not in the Nature of their Relation, but their Names. For the <hi>Names</hi> which agree to Relateds according to their <hi>Names</hi> ſignifie of themſelves firſt, an Abſolute <hi>thing,</hi> and ſecondly, connote a Relation which is <hi>included</hi> in that Abſolute thing. But to Relateds according to their Eſſence, are ſuch Names given, which of themſelves ſignifie a Relation, and connote an Abſolute thing, which that Relation preſuppoſes, as it were, its Subject. For Example: <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>a thing Knowable,</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Relateds according to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56895:23"/>their Names;</hi> becauſe Science is the Name of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which includes a Reſpect to the <hi>Object knowable,</hi> or which may be known. And therefore the whole Eſſence of Science is not placed in Reſpect to the Object <hi>which may be known:</hi> Nay, the Eſſence of Knowledge or Science is an Abſolute Quality, which is yet ſaid to be referred to another; becauſe it connotes a Relation. But <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateds <hi>according to their Eſſence;</hi> becauſe theſe Words of themſelves firſt ſignifie a Relation, or <hi>Mutual Reſpect;</hi> and therefore the whole <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> as he is <hi>Father,</hi> is placed in Reſpect to the <hi>Son;</hi> and that of the <hi>Son</hi> in Reſpect to his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> For what is it elſe to be a <hi>Father,</hi> but to have a <hi>Son,</hi> and to be a <hi>Son,</hi> but to have a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1. §. For Example: <hi>Father, Son; Husband, and Wife,</hi> and other <hi>Relateds of that ſort</hi> are real <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateds;</hi> becauſe the Father's being the Son's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Husband's the Wive's Husband, does not depend upon the Cogitation of our Mind. But Right and Left are Relations of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> becauſe that to one ſtanding betwixt two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, this ſhould be Right, that Left, rather
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56895:23"/>than the Contrary, is from the Ordination of the Mind.

To Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teds of Reaſon, alſo, Identity or Sameneſs is to be referred. For when any thing is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with it ſelf, as that it is ſaid to be the ſame with it ſelf, that one thing is ſo uſed by the Underſtanding as if it were two: Hitherto alſo refer Beings of Reaſon, which are mutually referred to each other, as <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> and <hi>Predicate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. In which Reciprocation, or mutual Relation, that which is the Subject of one Relation is the Term of the other; and ſo on the contrary.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 14. As alſo that which is in one Relation the <hi>Relate,</hi> is in the other the <hi>Correlate;</hi> and ſo on the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Theſe things that you may underſtand, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we between the Father and the Son, Two Relations to intercede; of which the One in which the Father is referred to the Son, is commonly called <hi>Paternity;</hi> the Other in which the Son is referred to the Father, <hi>Filiation</hi> or Son-ſhip. But
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56895:24"/>Paternity and Filiation are not one, but two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations diverſe from each other; Becauſe the Father is otherwiſe related towards the Son than the Son is towards the Father. Theſe Two Relations require two Subjects and two Terms, which are two Men; as, ſuppoſe <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Alexander; Philip</hi> is the Subject of Paternity, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Term. On the other ſide, <hi>Alexander</hi> is the Subject of Filiation; <hi>Philip,</hi> the Term; <hi>Father</hi> is the Relate in Paternity, <hi>Son</hi> the Correlate. On the other ſide, Son is the Relate in Filiation, Father the Correlate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. Father the Subject of Relation is wont vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly to be diſtinguiſhed into Subject of Inhaeſion, and Subject of Denomination. But theſe things have more in them of Subtilty than Truth.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 16. And a Foundation is that by whoſe Means the Relation accrews to the Subject.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Example: When an Egg is ſaid to be like an Egg, the Similitude between theſe two Eggs ariſes in each as ſoon as they begin to exiſt; nor is there any thing required towards their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, beſides the Exiſtence of two Eggs. But the Relation of Servant does not preſently ariſe in the Subject ſo ſoon as the Term exiſts; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves that ſomething elſe alſo do intercede upon which this Relation is founded: For a Servant is therefore the Servant of one; becauſe by him he has been either <hi>ſaved</hi> or <hi>purchaſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 17. Relateds are ſaid either to be Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, or of the ſame Name; or Heteronymous, <hi>viz.</hi> of a diverſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Relateds Synonymous are uſually called Relateds of Aequiparancy; as, <hi>Friend, Rival,</hi> &amp;c. Heteronymous of Diſquiparancy; as, <hi>Father, Son; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Servant,</hi> &amp;c. If the Relation which agrees
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56895:24"/>to <hi>Heteronyms</hi> has a <hi>Name,</hi> one of the two is called the <hi>Relate,</hi> to wit, that from which the <hi>Relation</hi> has its Name; the other, the <hi>Correlate.</hi> If the Relation be without a Name, as when the Buyer is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Seller, the Diſtinction of Related and Correlated depends only upon our ſelves; as alſo in <hi>Synonymous:</hi> For there is no reaſon why the <hi>Buyer</hi> ſhould be any more called the <hi>Related</hi> than the <hi>Correlated;</hi> or of two Friends, that <hi>the One ſhould be ſo called</hi> rather than the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 18. The Notes of Relateds are Five; and firſt, Relateds have a Contrary.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Relate is not contrary to its Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, but one related to another. This Note agrees not with Relateds <hi>per ſe;</hi> that is, <hi>by themſelves;</hi> but by Virtue of their Foundation or Subject, and therefore not to all: For nothing is contrary to <hi>Father or Son, double or half,</hi> but to ſuch only which lean on contrary Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or accrue to contrary Subjects: For Friend and Enemy are Contraries; becauſe the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Friendſhip and Enmity, <hi>viz.</hi> Good Will and Ill Will are Contraries; ſo like and unlike, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual and unequal are Contraries, becauſe the things themſelves or Subjects are Contraries. For Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is between the ſame Qualities, and Equality between the ſame Quantities. But Diſſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween divers Qualities, and Inequality between divers Quantities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 19. Secondly, Relateds receive more and leſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. This Note alſo agrees to Relateds in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Subject or Foundation, and therefore not to all Relateds. For a Father or a Maſter is no more a Father or a Maſter than another; but to ſuch only as lean upon a mutable Subject or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation: For when the Subject or Foundation is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Relation is intended or remitted. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: <hi>Thoſe things which are unequal, become more or leſs unequal, when Quantity, which is the Subject of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56895:25"/>Inequality, is in either of the two more or leſs. And diſſimilar things become more or leſs diſſimilar, when the Quality in either of them is either intended or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. That is, every Related is referred to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal Correlate: As, the Maſter is the Maſter of the Servant; and the Servant is the Servant of the Maſter. The half, the half of the double, and the double the double of the half. But it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through <hi>want of Words,</hi> that this Reciproca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not appear: For the Head is the Head of ſomething, and the Wing the Wing of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and yet to theſe there wants an anſwerable Correlate. For Animal cannot be a proper Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late for Head, becauſe all Animals have not a Head; nor can Bird be a proper Correlate for Wing; becauſe even Flies, Waſps, Batts, have Wings and yet are not Birds. It is therefore neceſſary, ſays <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> upon this Head, to feign Words altho' not ſo much uſed; that therefore the Reciprocation may be made apparent in the aforeſaid Relationss, we muſt ſay, the Head is the Head of ſomething having an Head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Wing the Wing of ſomething having a Wing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 21. Fourthly, Relateds are together in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. That is, as they are related: For altho' <hi>Philip</hi> be before <hi>Alexander,</hi> yet is not <hi>Philip</hi> a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before <hi>Alexander</hi> be a Son.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 22. Fifthly, Relateds are together in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Becauſe one Related as a Related cannot be known without the other: For altho' he may be known who is the Son, without knowing him who is the Father; yet can he not be known to be a Son, unleſs we know him to have a Father; nor can it be known, whoſe Son any one is, if we are ignorant who is his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. To ſuffer is to receive the Effect of the Agent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Action and Paſſion are not ſo much things as the Way to things, or the Manner after which things are done, and the Flux of that which is ſaid to be done.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. In Actions are to be diſtinguiſhed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, Patient</hi> or <hi>Subject;</hi> the <hi>Term from which,</hi> and the <hi>Term to which.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For Example: In the Action of <hi>Heating,</hi> the Agent is the Fire, or Sun; the Patient or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the Perſon who is warmed; the Term from which, Cold; the Term to which, Heat: For he who is warmed, is from being cold, made hot; the Term <hi>to which,</hi> is always ſome true thing; but the Term <hi>from which,</hi> is ſometimes only a true thing, and contrary to the Term <hi>to which;</hi> as in Calefaction or Heating: For Cold and Heat are true Qualities, and contrary one to the other: But ſometimes that <hi>from which</hi> is nothing elſe but a meer Privation of the Term <hi>to which;</hi> as when one from <hi>unlearned</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>learned:</hi> For when nothing is contrary to the Term <hi>to which,</hi> the Term <hi>from which</hi> is only privative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed to it.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. In every Action are neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, in <hi>Agent, a Term from which, and a Term to which.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. If the Term <hi>to which</hi> ſubſiſt of it ſelf, the Action conſiſts without a Patient.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For ſince Action is nothing elſe but a Flux of the Effect, or the Term <hi>to which in fieri,</hi> as they ſay. If the Term <hi>to which</hi> requires a Subject, as in all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except Creation it does, the Action alſo requires a Subject: For ſince the Effect of Creation or Term <hi>to which</hi> is the whole Subſtance, it follows, that Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation has no <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Patient.</hi> For Creation is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the producing of ſomething out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; <hi>that is,</hi> out of <hi>no Subjected Matter.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. For Action (as we have ſaid) is a Flux of the Effect, and therefore ought to be in that Subject in which it is effected; but the Effect is in the Patient, and therefore the Action <hi>ought</hi> to be in the Patient <hi>alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. Even Action and Paſſion differ not in the Thing it ſelf, but in Reſpect only to diverſe Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For there is but one Flux of one Effect, which, as it proceeds from the Agent, is ſaid to be Action; as receiv'd by the Patient, a Paſſion. For as the Way from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and from <hi>Thebes</hi> to <hi>Athens,</hi> is one only Way collated to diverſe Terms: And as the Riſing and Falling of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Hill differs only in Reſpect, ſo alſo Action and Paſſion are in this only Reſpect different; one being referred to the Agent, the other to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. §.

                  <p n="1">1. §. For Example: Illumination is an Action Perficient: For when the Air is enlighten'd it is done by Light, Nothing of Form deſtroyed; but <hi>Generation</hi> and <hi>Heating</hi> are Actions <hi>Corrupting:</hi> For when an Animal or any ſuch thing is generated, at the ſame time ſomething elſe is deſtroyed; and he that was <hi>hot, becomes ſo by the Diſmiſſion of the Cold.</hi> The Cauſe of this Difference is becauſe Action Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient is converſant amongſt <hi>Terms privatively oppoſed;</hi> corrupting between either <hi>Contruries</hi> or <hi>Diſparates.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. The Action of Heating is contrary to that of making cold; and ſome things heat or cool more, others leſs: And to heat more in this Place is not to heat more ſwiftly, but intenſly; that is, to produce a more intenſe Heat.</p>
                  <p>Both theſe Notes belong to Action upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Term <hi>to which,</hi> and therefore neither to <hi>all;</hi> but thoſe only whoſe Terms are contrary and receive <hi>Intenſion</hi> and <hi>Remiſſion:</hi> And therefore <hi>to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to figure,</hi> &amp;c. have <hi>no Contrary;</hi> nor are they <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> or <hi>remitted,</hi> becauſe <hi>Subſtance</hi> or <hi>Figure</hi> neither has a <hi>Coutrary,</hi> or is <hi>intended or remitted.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. Subalterns have two Habitudes or Relations: For they are Genus's and Species with a diverſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.

The Species may indeed be conferred ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Genus or Individuals: For it is to the Genus ſubjected, and predicated of the Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; but in both of theſe Collations it is a Species: For in Reſpect of the Genus it is called a ſubjected Species; or, as they vulgarly ſay, ſubjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible; and in Reſpect of the Individuals, a Predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or Predicable.

                  <p n="1">1. §. For when it is asked What is <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?</hi> It is rightly anſwered, a Man. A Species differs from Individuals; becauſe it is predicated of many;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56895:30"/>Genus's, becauſe of thoſe things which are different in Number. Thoſe things are ſaid to be different in Number, which when of the ſame Eſſence, may be numbred as many things; as the Individuals of the ſame Species.

                  <p n="1">1. §. To be unequally predicated of its Species is nothing, elſe but to agree to one Species more; to another leſs: Or to one immediately, to the other by ſome other. And this is when one Species de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon another. So <hi>Ens,</hi> if a <hi>Genus,</hi> is equivocal, becauſe Subſtance is more ſo than Accident. Nay, Accident is no being, any farther than as it depends upon Subſtance. But Animal is an Univocal Genus; becauſe Man is no more an Animal than a Beaſt, nor a Beaſt than a Man.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. To be ſaid Synonymouſly of a thing is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to be ſaid as to its Name and Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is before ſaid out of <hi>Ariſtotle, Cap.</hi> 5. of the Categories. But Genus is ſaid of the Species as to Name and Definition, becauſe participated of its Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Therefore it is ſaid of Species Synonymouſly. And this is taught Book 2. of the Topicks, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. Nor is the Genus only ſaid Synonymouſly of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, but alſo in the Queſtion in which it is <hi>asked,</hi> what <hi>the thing is:</hi> For all things which are anſwer'd to the Queſtion, what is it, are predicated Synony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly of the Species, as is aforeſaid; but cannot be rendred to the Queſtion, What is it? <hi>Paronymous</hi> thoſe things are called, which are ſaid of another as to Name only, not Definition; and that not in the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in which it is asked, what a thing is; but in which it is <hi>asked of what Quality it is;</hi> or in an <hi>Oblique Caſe.</hi> From whence follows that, that cannot be the <hi>Genus</hi> of any thing which is ſaid of it Paronymouſly.

                  <p n="1">1. §. This Rule is delivered Book 4. of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. but it is to be underſtood as to the Conſecution of the Exiſtence: For that Priority has Place here: for ſuppoſing the Species, you ſuppoſe the Genus; but not contrariwiſe.

For Example; Animal may be without Man or Beaſt; but not Man and Beaſt: But <hi>Ens</hi> not without <hi>Subſtance,</hi> but only Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. <hi>That</hi> therefore is a Genus Synonymous, <hi>this</hi> Homonymous: As alſo the <hi>Genus is</hi> towards its <hi>Species,</hi> ſo is the <hi>Species</hi> towards its Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 18. And altho' the Species may be preſerved in one <hi>Individual,</hi> yet cannot the Genus be ſo, in one <hi>Species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. That the Genus is of greater Latitude than its Species, and the Species than its Individual, and conſequently that the Genus is predicated of more than its Species, and the Species than its Individual, follows from the Definitions of them both, and is taught by <hi>Ariſtotle Book</hi> 4. <hi>of the Topicks,</hi> Cap. 1. But that the Species may be concerned in one Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, when the Genus, not <hi>in one Species,</hi> is from hence, becauſe the Species is more perfect in its Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence than the Genus, but not the Individual than its Species: For the Species includes its Genus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides its Genus an Eſſential Difference: But the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual has no Eſſential Difference added to the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but the Species abſolves its whole Eſſence, there being only Occaſion for Accidents, whereby it ſhould be diſcern'd from other Individuals of the ſame Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Since therefore a Species is conſtituted <hi>by a Genus,</hi> and an <hi>Eſſential Difference,</hi> and every Difference re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a <hi>Multitude,</hi> it follows that <hi>one Species</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſtitute a <hi>Genus.</hi> But Individuals have no Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential <hi>Difference by which</hi> to diſtinguiſh <hi>them</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves: For they agree in their <hi>whole Eſſence,</hi> and therefore no more <hi>Individuals</hi> are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the conſtituting of a <hi>Species.</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. §.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56895:33"/>thoſe of Species's with Species's, not Individuals, are to be conferred and reciprocated. So <hi>to be of Quantity is reciprocated with Natural Body</hi> and not <hi>the Heaven, or Element, or Stone.</hi> And Riſibility is to be reciprocated with <hi>Man, not Socrates</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi> When the Property then of the Genus is predicated of the Species; as, when the Heaven is ſaid to be of <hi>Quantity;</hi> or the Property of the Species with <hi>the Individual;</hi> as when <hi>Plato</hi> is ſaid to <hi>be riſible.</hi> The Predication is not of the Accident of the Subject, nor yet the Property: For the Number of Predicable ariſes from a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Predicate <hi>with the Proximate Subject.</hi> For thoſe compared with the <hi>remote</hi> are not of <hi>this Place;</hi> as have been beforeſaid.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. §. Propers either flow <hi>immediately from the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Subject;</hi> as <hi>Riſibility from the rational Soul,</hi> Quantity from <hi>the Eſſence of Natural Bodies:</hi> Or, by the Mediation of ſome other Property.

                     <p n="1">1. §. So that he would be guilty of a Contradiction that ſhould ſay or think that the Property was abſent from it: For whoſoever ſays or thinks a Body is not Quantity, or that the Fire is not hot, ſays or thinks as much as if he ſhould ſay or think, a Body is not a Body, or a Fire a Fire.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. §. So altho' the Moon does not always ſuffer an Eclipſe, yet when the Earth is interpoſed between the Sun and the Moon, it is as neceſſary it ſhould ſuffer an Eclipſe, as that a Body ſhould be a Quantity, or that the Fire ſhould be hot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. All Accidents may be ſeparated from their Subject in Thought, without a Contradiction. And herein they differ from Properties which cannot. For he who thinks a <hi>Crow not to be black, altho' he thinks falſe,</hi> yet he does not <hi>think a Crow not to be a Crow, or any thing from which it may follow a Crow is not a Crow.</hi> But he who conceives that <hi>the Fire is not hot,</hi> conceives that, from whence it muſt follow, that <hi>the Fire is not a Fire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 §. That Accident therefore is ſaid to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, which in Reality may be ſeparated, and not only <hi>thought;</hi> or without which the Subject may naturally exiſt; <hi>Inſeparable not:</hi> For God alſo may ſeparate inſeparable Accidents from their Subjects; becauſe he can do all things, which evert not one another, and imply not a Contradiction.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. §. The Whole without all doubt differs from its <hi>particular Parts:</hi> For the Man is one thing, and the Soul or Body another thing: It differs alſo from all the Parts <hi>taken together</hi> and <hi>not united:</hi> For a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Subſtance is different from Matter and Form, as is deliver'd in the Second Book <hi>de An.

                     <p n="1">1. §. And theſe are not ſo much different in the thing it ſelf as in Reaſon: For when Matter of it ſelf <hi>informed,</hi> and <hi>determined, receives Form,</hi> it is determined with Form to conſtitute a certain Species of <hi>Compoſitum.</hi> Both therefore <hi>conſtitute</hi> the Compoſed; Matter by <hi>receiving Form,</hi> and Form by determining or <hi>Forming Matter,</hi> and that by an <hi>Union intervening:</hi> For without an <hi>Union of Form with

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. To be produc'd out of <hi>the Power of Matter,</hi> is nothing elſe but to be produc'd by an Efficient Cauſe in the Matter; and ſo as that the Matter promotes that <hi>Action by its Cauſality.</hi> After this Manner are produc'd Material Forms. Forms Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material are alſo produc'd by an Efficient Cauſe in the Matter; but the Matter it ſelf does not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards the Action. And this <hi>properly is ſaid to create.</hi> Material Forms, not only <hi>when making, but alſo when made, depend upon Matter</hi> Immaterial, <hi>neither.</hi> Hence is it that thoſe are Corruptible, theſe Incorruptible. All Forms of Natural things, the Humane Soul excepted, are <hi>Material, which only is Immaterial.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. For Example: The Subſtantial Form of a Muſician, as he is Man, is <hi>the Rational Soul;</hi> Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental, as he is a Muſician, <hi>Muſick.</hi> In the like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Subſtantial Form of a Statue is, the Form it ſelf abſtractedly of <hi>the Marble or Braſs;</hi> Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, <hi>as a Statue, the Figure.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 18. Thirdly, Form is divided <hi>into Natural</hi> and <hi>Artificial.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 19. Natural is that, which <hi>is of Nature,</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial <hi>of Art.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. For Example: <hi>The Soul is the Form Natural of every living thing.</hi> The Forms of other Natural
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56895:41"/>things want <hi>Names,</hi> and therefore are to us <hi>almoſt unknown.</hi> Figure is the Artificial Form of a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as an <hi>Artificial thing;</hi> not as a Natural, to wit, <hi>Marble</hi> or <hi>Braſs:</hi> For Artificial Forms are <hi>Qualities of Natural things,</hi> no <hi>Formal Cauſes;</hi> but yet they are the Formal Cauſes of Artificial things, <hi>as Artificial:</hi> For Artificials are <hi>certain Accidents Concrete with their Subſtances.</hi>

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 20. <hi>Fourthly and Laſtly.</hi> Form is divided into <hi>Principal</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſing.</hi>

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 22. <hi>Diſponent,</hi> which diſpoſes <hi>the Matter to an Aptitude for the Reception of the Principal Form.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. The Principal Form <hi>is always a Subſtantial Form,</hi> diſpoſing either <hi>Accidental or Subſtantial.</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition Accidental <hi>is required</hi> in all things having a Subſtantial Form; Subſtantial <hi>in animated only.</hi> For Example: When Wood's burnt, it is <hi>firſt made hot and dryed, and after this manner made fit,</hi> to receive the Form of Fire. So likewiſe, when a Statue <hi>is made out of a Beam or Timber,</hi> it is <hi>by degrees to be diſpoſed</hi> and form'd into the Figure of a Statue. But when an Animal is to be generated of <hi>Seed,</hi> this <hi>Seed not only by its Qualities,</hi> but alſo <hi>Subſtantial Form</hi> is to be diſpoſed and made <hi>fit</hi> to receive the Soul; which Form in Reſpect of the <hi>Seed</hi> is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, tho' of the Soul, or Animal, a <hi>Diſpoſing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. §. Form alſo may be divided into <hi>Intelligible</hi> and <hi>Senſible;</hi> but of this <hi>enough has been ſaid already</hi> in the Doctrine of Matter.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. §. It <hi>ſometimes happens that a Cauſe cauſes the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> by the Mediation of ſome Action which is ſaid <hi>to be its Cauſality in cauſing.</hi> Such a Cauſe we call Active; ſometimes by its own <hi>Exiſtence</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Cauſality diſtinct from its Exiſtence; and this by ſome is <hi>call'd Emanative:</hi> Which Word tho' feign'd with Repugnance to the Analogy of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, yet is it to be uſed upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion till a more Convenient can be found out.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. A Cauſe Efficient is ſaid to be <hi>two ways Next;</hi> to wit, either <hi>generally</hi> or <hi>ſpecially.</hi> In general, that Cauſe is ſaid to be <hi>Next,</hi> which either by its <hi>Exiſtence</hi> they commonly ſay, <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> is joyned to the Effect: For ſuch <hi>Virtue</hi> being an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of the principal Cauſe, it is deem'd <hi>with the Principal</hi> to be one only. And therefore when the principal Cauſe by <hi>its Virtue</hi> is joyned to the <hi>Effect,</hi> it is <hi>its ſelf eſteemed</hi> to be joyned to the <hi>Effect.</hi> Neither is it <hi>any matter,</hi> whether that Virtue be an Inſtrument <hi>conjoyned</hi> or <hi>ſeparate.</hi> For Example: The Fire is ſaid to be the <hi>next Cauſe of Uſtion;</hi> Parents <hi>of their Children;</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Fire acts by Mediation <hi>of Heat,</hi> and the Parents of <hi>Seed:</hi> For <hi>altho' Heat and Seed</hi> are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,</hi> yet do they not effect <hi>by their Intervening;</hi> but that the principal Cauſe may be ſaid to be <hi>next</hi> to the Effect, A Cauſe therefore is ſaid to be remote <hi>in this Senſe,</hi> viz. which neither by its <hi>Exiſtence nor Virtue</hi> is joyned to the Effect: As when the Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father is ſaid to be the Cauſe of his <hi>Son's Son,</hi> or <hi>Grandſon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Cauſe Efficient is ſaid to be next in <hi>Species</hi> which is ſo joyned by its <hi>Exiſtence to its Effect;</hi> as that it is joyned to it without any <hi>mediating Virtue.</hi> And a next Cauſe has no Place in <hi>Subſtances,</hi> but only <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents</hi> eſpecially <hi>proper:</hi> For a Subſtance does not effect a Subſtance without ſome mediate or <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Virtue.</hi> And this is the Cauſe which is <hi>ſaid</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56895:47"/>to be abſolutely <hi>next;</hi> and that is either <hi>Internal</hi> or <hi>External.</hi> Internal is <hi>that</hi> which is in <hi>the Subject of the Accident,</hi> of which it is the Cauſe.

                  <p n="1">1. §. As for <hi>Inſtance,</hi> The <hi>of</hi> which, of Medicine is <hi>Health; for</hi> which, <hi>the Sick.</hi>

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>For Example:</hi> The principal End of <hi>Clothes, is,</hi> that our Bodies ſhould be defended againſt the <hi>Inclemency of the Heavens;</hi> the Secondary <hi>Conjoyned</hi> with that Principal, is that they ſhould <hi>adorn it.</hi> So the Principal End for which <hi>God was pleas'd</hi> to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf in the Creation of <hi>the World, was, that Man ſhould be endued</hi> with the Knowledge of <hi>God and Piety:</hi> The Secondary and Succedaneous, that he <hi>might render them inexcuſable,</hi> who holding the Truth <hi>in Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> go on ſtill <hi>in Iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> End is divided into <hi>Subordinate</hi> and <hi>Laſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. A Subordinate <hi>End</hi> is that which is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>ſome farther End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. The <hi>Laſt,</hi> to which <hi>all other Ends are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;</hi> that it ſelf to no farther.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. There is often a long Series of Subordinate Ends, in which the Subordinate is <hi>a Means</hi> in Reſpect of the <hi>Sequent End.</hi> For <hi>Example:</hi> One digging in the Earth, to <hi>fetch out Iron:</hi> Iron is <hi>drawn out,</hi> that of it may be made <hi>ſome Inſtrument,</hi> which may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable for our <hi>Uſe:</hi> As, ſuppoſe <hi>a Penknife,</hi> or <hi>a Lancet;</hi> the Lancet inſerves the Phyſician for <hi>the Cutting of the Vein;</hi> the Cutting of the Vein to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>Superfluous Blood,</hi> or take away the <hi>Vitious.</hi> The Loſs of Blood conduces to <hi>the Conſervation</hi> or <hi>Recuperation</hi> of Health. Our Health indeed <hi>of it ſelf</hi> is to be deſired; but referred <hi>notwithſtanding</hi> to this End, that our Actions may be <hi>free and Expedite.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions again are referred either to <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> or <hi>Glory,</hi> or <hi>Honeſty,</hi> or <hi>ſomething elſe;</hi> in which Subordination of Ends there is no going to Infinity as we have taught before. For otherwiſe <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>fruitleſs,</hi> would be that <hi>Appetition</hi> which Nature has planted in all things; as the Philoſopher argues Book 1. of the Ethicks,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56895:48"/>
                     <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. There is therefore ſome chief End in which the Appetite <hi>muſt terminate</hi> and <hi>acquieſce.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. An End is ſaid to be <hi>two ways</hi> laſt; either in its <hi>own Genus</hi> or <hi>abſolutely.</hi> That is ſaid to be ſo in its own Genus, which is the <hi>laſt</hi> amongſt thoſe <hi>Ends</hi> which are intended by the <hi>ſame Agent.</hi> So in that Series which I have brought, there are many Ends which are <hi>laſt in their own Genus:</hi> For to fetch forth Iron is the <hi>laſt End</hi> of ſuch <hi>who dig in the Mines;</hi> the Penknife of <hi>the Smith,</hi> Health of the <hi>Phyſician:</hi> But there is but one <hi>abſolutely laſt,</hi> and that is <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. §. That End which is <hi>ſubordinated in its own Genus,</hi> is referr'd to a farther End by it <hi>ſelf:</hi> But that which is <hi>laſt, by Accident.</hi> For Example: The Smith ſoftens Iron in the <hi>Fire,</hi> puts it upon <hi>the Anvil, ſtrikes it, hammers it, poliſhes it, whets it,</hi> till of it he makes a <hi>Lancet.</hi> All theſe <hi>by themſelves,</hi> and in reſpect of the ſame <hi>Agent,</hi> viz. <hi>the Smith,</hi> are ſubordinated: For the Lancet is the <hi>whole Endeavour</hi> of the Smith. But that it ſhould be ſerviceable to the Phyſician in letting of Blood is <hi>no Care</hi> of the <hi>Smith's;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thoſe things which the Smith does in Order to the making the <hi>Lancet,</hi> are ſubordinated to this End of the <hi>Pyſician's</hi> by <hi>Accident.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. When the End is <hi>good,</hi> by how much the farther off <hi>it is,</hi> by ſo much the <hi>better it muſt needs be;</hi> the laſt <hi>End therefore muſt be the beſt, and the chief Good it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. This Theorem is extant Book 1. of the Eth. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. That the End is <hi>good, is aboveſaid;</hi> Otherwiſe it would not move the Efficient: Nor is it <hi>yet ſufficient</hi> that it be <hi>good;</hi> but it ought alſo to be good of it <hi>ſelf;</hi> ſince the Means are no <hi>otherwiſe good</hi> than as they are ſerviceable to the obtaining <hi>of the End;</hi> from whence follows that the End is better than the Means. But the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate is a Means in reſpect of the Sequent, that is, the ſubordinate End. The <hi>laſt End</hi> therefore is
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56895:48"/>ſomething <hi>which is beſt;</hi> becauſe in no <hi>reſpect a means</hi> by which it ſhould become <hi>worſe:</hi> Nor is it material whether this End be <hi>real or imaginary,</hi> as is ſaid Book 4. of the Metaph. <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. Since the End no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moves the <hi>Efficient,</hi> than as it <hi>ſeems</hi> to be good, and ſo we come to the next Axiom, which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 12. By how much an End is the <hi>laſt in the Execution,</hi> by ſo much the earlier is it <hi>in the Intenſion.</hi> And ſo <hi>on the contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. End alſo is divided into <hi>Internal and External;</hi> but this Diviſion has not Place <hi>in all things,</hi> but only <hi>Faculties and Arts Conjectural,</hi> in which that is ſaid to be <hi>Internal,</hi> which the Artificer attains to as <hi>often as he pleaſes;</hi> External, which he <hi>does not</hi> always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to: So the Internal of <hi>Oratory</hi> is to <hi>ſpeak Ornately,</hi> and <hi>Accommodately to perſuade;</hi> the External to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. The Diviſion of End into End by <hi>it ſelf,</hi> and End by <hi>Accident,</hi> as vulgarly underſtood is not <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Fault:</hi> For an End by Accident is not <hi>a Final Cauſe:</hi> For a Final Cauſe is not <hi>a Cauſe</hi> any farther than it is intended. But an End by Accident is not <hi>intended,</hi> but evenes beſides <hi>the Intention.</hi> Wherefore when an End <hi>is ſaid</hi> to be by <hi>Accident,</hi> the Event or Effect <hi>by Accident</hi> is to be underſtood: For if any one <hi>digging</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> that he may make it more Fertile, ſhould by Accident find <hi>a Treaſure,</hi> the finding that Treaſure will not be <hi>the End,</hi> but <hi>Effect,</hi> or <hi>Event of it by Accident.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. Nature two Ways, <hi>viz. in Conſecution of Exiſtence, and Cauſality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> indeed affirms that alone to be <hi>firſt in Nature</hi> which is <hi>firſt in Cauſality:</hi> But that alſo ſeems to be reaſonably ſo call'd which is firſt in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of Exiſtence,</hi> viz.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. §. This <hi>Simplicius</hi> interprets in <hi>this manner:</hi> That, ſays he, is ſaid to be firſt, which, another thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppoſed, is it ſelf ſuppoſed: But that ſuppoſed, that other thing is not ſuppoſed. For Example: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Binary Number, you ſuppoſe alſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but ſuppoſing Unity, you ſuppoſe not the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Number;</hi> and ſuppoſing Man, you ſuppoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Animal; but ſuppoſing Animal, you do not
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56895:60"/>ſuppoſe alſo <hi>Man:</hi> Unity therefore, is <hi>before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Number, and Animal before Man:</hi> And likewiſe every <hi>Genus before its Species, and Species its Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, as to Conſecution of Exiſtence.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. So the Sun is before its <hi>Light,</hi> and Thing Truth of Speech. For altho' the Sun and Light, Thing and Truth of Speech may be reciprocated <hi>according to Conſecution of Exiſtence,</hi> and mutually take away, and ſuppoſe <hi>each other:</hi> Yet the Sun is <hi>the Cauſe of its Light, and the Thing of Verity in Speech:</hi> Becauſe as the Thing <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>is not,</hi> the Oration is ſaid to be <hi>true or falſe.</hi> In this manner, therefore, the Sun is <hi>ſaid to be before its Light, and the Thing Verity in Speech.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. Things alſo are ſaid to be <hi>together</hi> as many Ways <hi>as firſt:</hi> But <hi>Two</hi> are more uſed than the reſt, and thoſe are <hi>Time and Nature.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. §. Synonyma's, in <hi>Latin, Univocals,</hi> are with Grammarians, <hi>Words of the ſame Signification, as</hi> Enſis, Gladius, <hi>Sword, Rapier,</hi> &amp;c. By Logicians Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyms are either ſtrictly taken, or largely. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyms ſtrictly. are ſaid to be thoſe <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>of the Categories,</hi> which are, with the ſame Reaſon <hi>Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſaid of many things;</hi> or, as to Name and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition; as, <hi>when Animal is ſaid both of Man and Beaſt.</hi> The Larger is, when all thoſe <hi>are call'd Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonyms which are not Homonyms;</hi> which is the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of this Place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. §. The Name only is ſaid to be common to Homonyms, not that Accidents of Names, ſuch as <hi>Genus, Declination, Conjugation, Spirit, Quantity, Accident,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be excluded: For if theſe were not the ſame, neither would the Name ſo be, but that the <hi>Ratio of Eſſence only;</hi> that is, that which <hi>is explained in the Definition:</hi> Nor is it yet ſufficient in Homonyms that the <hi>Ratio</hi> of Eſſence <hi>be diverſe</hi> but alſo, it is neceſſary that they be diverſe, as to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56895:64"/>
                        <hi>the Common Name, or as they convene in that Common Name.</hi> For Example: <hi>Animal is a Common Name to Man and Beaſt, and yet not an Homonym:</hi> For altho' one is the Definition of <hi>Man, another of Beaſt, as they differ in Names,</hi> yet convene they in one Definition, which anſwers to the Common Name of <hi>Animal,</hi> and that is enough to hinder it here from being an Homonym; But if Animal be referr'd to a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Animal</hi> and a Painted, <hi>'tis an Homonym;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Definition is in common to a <hi>Living Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and a Painted,</hi> that is accommodated to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Name of Animal. And ſo we come to the third Axiom which ſhews us,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. <hi>Viz.</hi> That Homonymy, <hi>is either Caſual, or Deſigned.</hi>

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. By Caſuality then it is ſaid to be when the ſame Word is impoſed upon <hi>divers things without Reaſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. As ſometimes they are from their proper Significations to <hi>ſome other;</hi> becauſe of that mutual Habitude or Relation, <hi>which things may have each to the other, whether ſimple or Analogical.</hi> And theſe are large in their Extent, as Trope.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. Reaſon of unequal Attribution, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe ſignifie that common Nature which is unequally communicated to its ſubjected Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies's.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. By Reaſon of us, the Homonymy is when for the ſake of the <hi>Memory of any Perſon near and dear to us, or ſome Illuſtrious Perſon in Hopes of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, or the like, we impoſe ſuch and ſuch Names upon our Children and Friends.</hi>

Of theſe the fartheſt diſtant from Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms, that is, ſuch as we have in the Beginning of this Chapter defined, <hi>are Homonyms by Chance, and thoſe whoſe Reaſon or Homonymy is in us:</hi> More nearly, <hi>the Tropicks, and firſt the Analogous:</hi> Neareſt of all, thoſe that are Ambiguous by reaſon of <hi>Unequal At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. Now the general Cauſe of Homonymy, or <hi>Ambiguity is the Infinite Multitude of things and Pauci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Words:</hi> For by reaſon of that <hi>much greater Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Words than Things,</hi> of Neceſſity one Word muſt be applied to ſignifie many things. But the Cauſe why this Word or that Word is Homony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is either <hi>none, as in Homonymy by Chance:</hi> Or if there be any which may move a wiſe Man to make uſe of the ſame Word to ſignifie many things it is either the Change of the Word, <hi>from its proper Signification, as in the Tropicks; or unequal Attribution as in them, which convene not equally to Inferiours;</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſome ones <hi>Memory, or the Hope of Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or Example.</hi> For Inſtance; the Word <hi>Jus</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi> ſignifies both Broth and that which is oppos'd to Injuſtice, the Homony my is by Chance: For there is no Reaſon why this Name ſhould be impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on things, having no Affinity at all amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 §. <hi>What, and how many ſold Trope is, is to be known from the Rhetoricians:</hi> But Trope cauſes Homonomy, becauſe a Sentence pronounc'd in Tropical Words, <hi>may be ambiguous and ſallacious,;</hi> as, when the Word <hi>fox</hi> is put for <hi>a Guil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And even all theſe have their Cauſes of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity in <hi>Things.</hi> Others alſo there are, which we have ſaid, have their Cauſes of Ambiguity <hi>in us, and our Will;</hi> as when we give the Name of the Parent to the Child, for the Conſervation of his Memory, or ſome Pious and Learned Perſon, hoping that ours may be excited by his Example to become like unto him.

A Predicate is ſaid to agree with the Subject, as, the Subject is that which it is, when there is nothing elſe in the Subject to which it can firſt be attributed; as of theſe two Enunciations; <hi>Man is Senſible, Man is Riſible.</hi> The former is not Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally firſt; becauſe to be Senſible, does not convene to Man as he is Man, but as he is an Animal, to which in the firſt Place it is to be attributed; but to be Riſible, convenes to him as Man; becauſe to none it is to be Attributed before Man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Terms are ſaid to be Reciprocal, when there may be a Converſion of the Predicate into the Place of the Subject, and ſo on the contrary, that is, when one may be put into the Place of the other. As for Inſtance, as one may ſay, every Man is Riſible, ſo one may ſay that every Riſible is Man. But altho' one may ſay every Man is Senſible, yet
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56895:75"/>cannot one ſay that every Senſible is Man, and ſo in other Inſtances: And that we may fully know, when an Enunciation is Univerſally firſt, it is to be obſerved that when the Predicate may be ſaid of the Subject with theſe Particles, <hi>viz. quà, quatenus, quia, that is as, ſo as, becauſe,</hi> &amp;c. that is, when with the Predicate, either any Cauſal or Reduplicative Particle may be uſed, the Enunciation is always Univerſally firſt; as Man as, and becauſe he is Man, is Riſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When otherwiſe the Enunciation muſt be of ſome other Degree.</p>

For Example: This Enunciation, <hi>Some Church is in the City,</hi> muſt not be converted into this; <hi>Some City is in the Church;</hi> but this, <hi>Something which is in the City is a Church;</hi> becauſe the Predicate of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation to be converted, <hi>is not City,</hi> but, <hi>to be in it.</hi> In like manner, the Predicate of this Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Every old Man was a Boy's,</hi> not <hi>only Boy, but was a Boy.</hi> And therefore not to be converted into this, <hi>viz.

                     <p n="3">3 §. One thing is here to be obſerv'd, that thoſe Enunciations which have the Mode Neceſſary, be neceſſary of themſelves: For if they have not this Neceſſity, the Converſion will be falſe: <hi>As, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that every old Man ſhould have been a Boy, and therefore that ſome one that was a Boy ſhould be an old Man. Every learned Perſon ſhould have been taught, and therefore that ſome one who has been taught ſhould be learned,</hi> &amp;c. Such Converſions as theſe do not <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here;</hi> Becauſe that an old Man ſhould have been a Boy, or a learned Man taught, is not neceſſary of its ſelf, or abſolutely, but only <hi>of every one,</hi> becauſe by the Supernatural Power of God it might have been otherwiſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Converſion of Modals in the other Moods can not be preſcrib'd by any certain Rules: For thoſe things that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays in <hi>the firſt Book of Prior.</hi> Cap. 3. <hi>have more in them of Difficulty than Uſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the Aequipollency or like Value of Enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Senſe, which differ in Words, which the Author ſays ſomething of, I thought it of little Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy to be mentioned here; and therefore I paſs'd it by as well that of thoſe differing in Site of the Negative-Particle only, as Mood. The Rules about one and the other being no great Matter; and for that Aequipollencies of this Nature, may eaſily be diſcern'd without Rule.</p>

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. By Subalternation we expreſs our Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when we would ſignifie that one Enunciation
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56895:77"/>is ſubordinated to another, and does neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from it, but not on the contrary, as Particulars and Singulars from Univerſals, to which they are <hi>indiſpenſably and neceſſarily</hi> ſubordinate.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. For if every Man is Mortal, then alſo this or that Man muſt <hi>be ſure</hi> to be Mortal: And if none, then this or <hi>that Man to be ſure, is not ſo,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. §.

                     <hi>Axiom</hi> 1. A Definition is ſaid <hi>to be an Oration,</hi> viz. Internal or External, that is, either in the Mind, or brought forth in Words, <hi>declaring what that is which is ſought.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. Which conſiſteth in two Words at the leaſt: And therefore an Explication <hi>of one Name by another more known, as if one ſhould call a Rapier a Sword,</hi> cannot properly be call'd a Definition, but yet it muſt be referr'd to Definition, as we ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards make appear. The Reaſon why Definition muſt be a Speech is plainly this: Such is the Imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillity of our Minds, that by one Conception we cannot eaſily attain to the Eſſence of a thing. That Definition therefore might occur, that is, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate it ſelf <hi>to this Imbecillity,</hi> it diſtributes the thing <hi>into Parts,</hi> viz. Genus, and Difference, or the like, and <hi>ſo delivers it to be underſtood by the Mind by many Conceptions, calling each Part by its Name.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. Definition of the Name is that which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, what that is which is ſaid; or what <hi>is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Name.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. Nominal Definition appears to be three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is <hi>according to Etymology,</hi> and ſo declares the Signification of the Name out of the Original.

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. The Laws of Perfect are principally <hi>Six,</hi> and the firſt is that the Definition be ſhort.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now Definitions are ſaid to be ſhort when there is nothing leſs, nor more in 'em <hi>than there ought to be.</hi> Now that there may be ſomething more, <hi>may chiefly happen three Ways;</hi> and firſt, when a Tautology is <hi>committed;</hi> which is not only then when the ſame thing is repeated <hi>by a Synonymous Word;</hi> as if a Man ſhould be defin'd to <hi>be a Rational Animal, and endu'd with the Power of Underſtanding;</hi> which is the ſame thing in other Words; but alſo, when that is put into the Definition <hi>of the Species</hi> which ought to have been put into the <hi>Definition of the Genus:</hi> As if Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould be defin'd to be <hi>a Privation of the Sight, which naturally ought to have in-been:</hi> For thoſe Words which naturally ought to have in-been, <hi>are Redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> and included in the Word <hi>Privation it ſelf:</hi> That, Secondly, is <hi>otiosè,</hi> or unneceſſary in a Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which diſtinguiſhes <hi>not the Defined</hi> from any other thing, <hi>as Tranſcendents;</hi> As if Virtue ſhould be defin'd to be that for which a Man ſhould be <hi>accounted Honeſt,</hi> &amp;c. In this manner yet, are chief Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56895:82"/>to be defin'd. In the third Place, <hi>that is ſaid to be otiosè</hi> in a Definition, which being <hi>taken away,</hi> the Definition would nevertheleſs be proper, and explain the Nature of the <hi>Thing;</hi> as if a Man ſhould ſay of a Man, that he was a Rational Animal <hi>capable of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines:</hi> For al tho' that of <hi>Capable of Diſciplines</hi> ſhould be withdrawn, yet the reſt of the Definition would be proper to explain <hi>the Eſſence of Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. Secondly, Definitions ought to be Perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Perſpicuity of Definitions, ſays the Prince of Philoſophers, ought to be ſuch as that it may preſently appear what that is which is taught: Nay, that from it, that of the Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary alſo may be collected. All thoſe things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are to be <hi>avoided,</hi> which may any ways beget Obſcurity; as, <hi>Unuſualneſs, Ambiguity, Metaphor,</hi> &amp;c. But if there be none proper, or elſe if any Word be more uſed in the Metaphorical than it is in the Proper Signification, nothing hinders but that we may <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit a Metaphorical Word in a Definition.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Logick is defin'd to be an Art of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting well, expreſſing by the Word <hi>Diſſerendi,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing properly ſomething elſe; that Definition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly rejected for the Metaphor; becauſe the Word <hi>Diſſerendi</hi> is much ſeldomer uſed in its proper Signification, <hi>which is to diſtribute or diſperſe,</hi> than in the Metaphorical; tho' ſomething elſe <hi>poſſibly there may be, which may be reprehended in that Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. Thirdly, Definitions ought to be <hi>Reciprocal with the Defined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. That is, whatever is <hi>contain'd in the Defined</hi> ought alſo ſo to be in the <hi>Definition; and ſo on the contrary.</hi> Wherefore when the Lawyers define natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Right to be that which Nature has taught <hi>all living Things, the Definition is too lax:</hi> For Right conſiſts only <hi>amongſt Men,</hi> and appertaineth not to <hi>Brutes.</hi> On the other ſide, when Logick is defined to be an
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56895:82"/>Art <hi>of Diſputing or Arguing well,</hi> the Definition is <hi>too ſtreight:</hi> For Logick is not only a diſputing or <hi>Art of Diſputing,</hi> but alſo Defining, Dividing and Ordering well, which are not ſufficiently contained <hi>under that Notion of Diſputing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. Fourthly, Definitions are to be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For that Negative Definitions do not ſo much explain what a Thing is, as what it is not: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> having propos'd two Definitions of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, Book</hi> 1. <hi>Top.</hi> Cap. 5. preferrs the latter before the former, becauſe conceiv'd by <hi>Negation.</hi> Often yet are we forc'd thro' the Inopy of Words, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity of our Underſtanding, or Imperfections of things, to make uſe <hi>of Negative Definitions;</hi> as, when we define an Angel <hi>to be a Finite Subſtance, void of Body, a Beaſt, an Irrational Animal; Blindneſs a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Sight.</hi> But then they are Imperfect Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. Fifthly, Definitions <hi>ought to be propos'd without Copulation or Conjunction of Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For a Definition is the Explication <hi>of one Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> and therefore it ought to be one and that a <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Oration;</hi> But Copulative and Disjunctive <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles connect many together.</hi> For Example: A Man is not to be defin'd <hi>a Terreſtrial Animal and two-footed,</hi> but <hi>a Terreſtrial two-footed Animal;</hi> as is collected <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. of the Interpret. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. Book 2. of the Poſt. After the ſame manner Number is not to be defin'd, <hi>a Multitude even or uneven:</hi> For this is its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, <hi>but a Collection of Unites.</hi> But ſuch Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as theſe are frequently to be diſpens'd with, <hi>not becauſe perfect,</hi> but becauſe there <hi>are no perfecter:</hi> as when Book 2. of the Phyſ. Nature is defin'd to be <hi>the Principle and Cauſe of Motion and Quiet;</hi> and Enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. of the Book of Interp. <hi>an Oration pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing true or falſe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. Sixthly, Definitions are to conſiſt of <hi>Prior Attributes, and ſimply more known, and alſo Indemon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1 §. This Canon does the Philoſopher explain and confirm in the 6th Book of the Top. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. to this Effect.

<q>
                        <l>Every Animal feels:</l>
                        <l>Every Man is an Animal:</l>

                  <p>In which the laſt Extreme or Subject is <hi>plainly Man</hi> the firſt or <hi>Predicate feels; Medium, Animal.</hi> Where Man is contain'd under Animal, and Animal that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56895:92"/>which feels. Let us ſee another Argumentation, <hi>viz.</hi> This.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>No Animal is a Stone:</l>
                     <l>Every Man is an Animal:</l>

                        <l>Every Animal lives:</l>
                        <l>Something therefore, that lives, or is living, feels.</l>

For Example: In the Syllogiſm <hi>of the fourth Figure above:</hi> Animal <hi>is the middle Term,</hi> Feels, therefore muſt be the Major, becauſe predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated <hi>of Animal;</hi> and Men the Minor, becauſe <hi>Subject;</hi> From whence follows that this Propoſition, <hi>Every Animal feels;</hi> is the Major Propoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein the Major Term is joyn'd to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, and this, <hi>Every Man is an Animal;</hi> Minor, becauſe therein the Medium is joyned with <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor:</hi> And conſequently this the Concluſion, <hi>viz. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man therefore feels;</hi> Not this, <hi>viz.

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Syllogiſms univerſal <hi>denying</hi> lean upon the Rule of <hi>None,</hi> which is this: <hi>Whatſoever is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally denyed of any Univerſal, is alſo denyed of all which contain'd under that Univerſal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. For Example; Deny we <hi>Stone</hi> of Animal; as no Animal is a Stone: Now Man is contained under Animal: <hi>For every Man is an Animal;</hi> and therefore Stone muſt alſo be denyed of <hi>Man: For no Man is a Stone;</hi> and this is a <hi>Syllogiſm denying</hi> in the firſt Figure.

Whatſoever Predicate is univerſally affirmed or Denyed of any Medium, that alſo is affirmed or denyed of that Subject, which is contained under that Medium,</hi> wherein there are <hi>three diſtinct Parts,</hi> of which the firſt repreſents the Major, ſecond the Concluſion, and third the Minor.</p>

As for Inſtance; If two Trees are equal to the ſame Meaſure, it is rightly collected, that thoſe Trees are equal alſo <hi>amongſt themſelves:</hi> So alſo if it may be truly affirmed of <hi>David</hi> that he was a <hi>Prophet and a Manſlayer,</hi> it follows that ſome <hi>Prophet was a Manſlayer,</hi> and that in ſuch a Syllogiſm as this.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. That the more eaſily true Syllogiſms may be diſcern'd from Paralogiſms, ſome Laws are to <hi>be obſerv'd,</hi> of which ſome are common to all; others peculiar to each Figure.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. The Common Laws are ſeven; and firſt, in a Syllogiſm <hi>there muſt be no more or leſs than three Terms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. This Law is preſcribed <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>Prior.</hi> Cap. 25. and is thus prov'd: A Queſtion has but two <hi>Terms,</hi> viz. <hi>Major and Minor,</hi> or Subject and Predicate: The Medium or Argument is taken from without; and <hi>that ought to be but one; as we have ſhewn,</hi> Cap. 6. <hi>of this Book.</hi> Tho'</p>
                     <p n="2">2. §. It often happens that there are four Terms in a Syllogiſm when there ſeems to be but three;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56895:98"/>and that chiefly for three Cauſes: And firſt, becauſe ſome Word or Sentence in the Syllogiſm <hi>is doubtful;</hi> as in this Syllogiſm,
<q>
                           <l>That which wants Beginning and End, is Eternal;</l>
                           <l>The World wants Beginning and End;</l>
                           <l>Therefore the World is Eternal.</l>
                        </q> There are four <hi>Terms,</hi> becauſe Beginning and End in the <hi>Major,</hi> are to be underſtood of <hi>Duration,</hi> in the Minor <hi>of Magnitude.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. §. Secondly, becauſe <hi>Concretes</hi> are confounded with <hi>Abſtracts, or Abſtracts with Concretes,</hi> as in this Syllogiſm:
<q>
                           <l>Whiteneſs is a Quality;</l>
                           <l>Snow is white:</l>
                           <l>Therefore Snow is a Quality.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. §. Thirdly, becauſe the <hi>Caſes</hi> are chang'd in the Nouns, or <hi>Tenſes</hi> in the Verbs; as in theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples:
<q>
                           <lg>
                              <l>All Servants are their own Maſters; <hi>That is,</hi> Servants of their own Maſters:</l>

                                 <hi>Davus</hi> is a Servant:</l>
                              <l>Therefore <hi>Davus</hi> is his own Maſter.</l>
                           </lg>
                           <lg>
                              <l>No Boy ever lived long;</l>
                              <l>
                                 <hi>Neſtor</hi> was a Boy:</l>

                           </lg>
                        </q> But if the ſame Mutation of <hi>Caſe or Time</hi> that is made in the Premiſſes, be made alſo in the <hi>Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it maketh not a <hi>Fourth Term:</hi> As appears from theſe Examples.</p>

                              <hi>Davus</hi> is a Servant:</l>
                           <l>Therefore <hi>Davus</hi> is of his Maſter, <hi>that is, belonging to him.</hi>

                              <hi>Neſtor</hi> was a Boy:</l>

                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. The ſecond Law is, that there ſhould be no more nor leſs in the Concluſion than there was in the Premiſſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. <hi>That is,</hi> The Extremes which were with the Medium diſpoſed in the Premiſſes, ſhould be ſo poſited in the Concluſion as they were in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, without any either <hi>Addition or Detraction:</hi> For if any thing be <hi>either added or withdrawn,</hi> there will be four Terms, as appears from the following Examples.
<q>
                           <lg>
                              <l>Thoſe which pleaſe God are happy;</l>
                              <l>All thoſe which are faithful pleaſe God:</l>
                              <l>All thoſe which are faithful therefore are happy and are afflicted with no Calamities.</l>
                           </lg>

                              <l>Some Men are not admitted into Favour:</l>
                              <l>Some Men therefore are not Sinners.</l>
                           </lg>
                        </q> For both Syllogiſms are <hi>Vitious:</hi> the firſt, becauſe there is more; and the ſecond, becauſe leſs <hi>in the Concluſion</hi> than there <hi>was in the Premiſſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. The third is, the Medium muſt not <hi>enter the Concluſion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="1">1. §. Vitious therefore are thoſe Syllogiſms in which either the whole, or Part of the Medium is included in it; For Example;

                     <p n="1">1. §.

<q>

                     <q>By <hi>Napcas, Nipcis,</hi> or <hi>Nipis, Repcere Cepres,</hi> And <hi>Ropcos, Copros, Noſrop,</hi> you'll find every Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</q> In which Verſicles are to be conſidered, Firſt, the Vowels <hi>A, E, I, O,</hi> which denote the Quality and Quantity <hi>of the Concluſion according to the accuſtomed Valuation.</hi> And then the Conſonants <hi>N, C, R, S, P.</hi> Of which <hi>N denotes</hi> the Antecedent, <hi>C</hi> the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, <hi>R</hi> the Repugnant, <hi>S</hi> the Subject, <hi>P</hi> the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore <hi>if a Univerſal Concluſion Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming be to be proved, Napcas</hi> will ſhew by its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants <hi>N, P, C, S.</hi> that a <hi>Medium is required,</hi> which is Amtecedent of the Predicate and Conſequent of the Subject; and if <hi>a Particular Affirming: Nipcis,</hi> that there is need of a Medium, that is Antecedent of the Predicate alſo, and Conſequent of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: <hi>Nipis</hi> Antecedent of <hi>both.</hi> If a Univerſal <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying,</hi> the Word <hi>Repcere</hi> ſhews that the Medium ought to be <hi>Repugnant of the Predicate and Conſequent of the Subject;</hi> and ſo by the Confonants, minding only what it is they ſignifie, it will <hi>be eaſie for a Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> to whom <hi>this is principally ſignificant,</hi> to determine of the reſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. AN Induction is a <hi>Syllogiſm</hi> in which <hi>one Extreme is concluded by the other of the Medium;</hi> alſo defined <hi>a Progreſs from Singulars to U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſals.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. An Induction is ſo called, becauſe by thoſe things <hi>which are certain,</hi> it induces the Mind of <hi>the Hearer to believe thoſe that are Uncertain.</hi> Now an Induction collects the greateſt Extreme, that is, <hi>the Predicate</hi> of the Medium by the other Extreme, <hi>that is, the Subject, and all thoſe things that are like unto it.</hi> So in an Induction, <hi>for Inſtance,</hi> it's proved, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals <hi>void of Bile are long-liv'd; becauſe a Man, a Horſe, an Aſs,</hi> &amp;c. are long-liv'd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. § When an Induction is ſaid to be a Progreſs from Singulars to Univerſals, the Words muſt not be too ſtrictly taken; For there are two ſorts of it, as thus explained, <hi>viz.</hi> one by which the Genus is collected of the <hi>Species's,</hi> or Univerſal of Singulars; and the other in which the Whole of the Parts. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of which are to be met with almoſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Author. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle Book</hi> 8. <hi>of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks,</hi> Cap. 1. proves Friendſhip neceſſary to Men: To the Rich, becauſe <hi>it Exerciſes their Charity, and conſerves a Proſperous Fortune;</hi> Poor, <hi>becauſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge and Supply;</hi> Old Men, <hi>that they may be reverenced;</hi> and what cannot by themſelves be done by reaſon of their Infirmities, may be done <hi>by others that are their Friends.</hi> Youth, <hi>for fear they commit Sin;</hi> Vigorous Age, <hi>that it may perform famous Enterpriſes,</hi> &amp;c. and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56895:104"/>this is an Induction of the firſt kind, and properly a <hi>Progreſſion from Singulars to Univerſals,</hi> or at leaſt, <hi>leſs Univerſals to more.</hi> But an Example <hi>of the other</hi> it would be, if one ſhould prove the Holy Scriptures <hi>to be divinely inſpired,</hi> becauſe the Law, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, the Goſpels, and Writings of the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>&amp;c. are divinely inſpir'd;</hi> and this would be <hi>but improperly called a Progreſſion from Singulars to Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals;</hi> and ſo of like Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. That the Induction may <hi>be firm,</hi> all the Singulars are to be numbered up, <hi>that from thence</hi> the Univerſals, or alſo all the Parts, that from hence <hi>the Whole may be concluded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. Or if this <hi>be too troubleſome</hi> after an Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſeveral, it may be <hi>ſubjoyn'd</hi> that the Ratio of the <hi>reſt is the ſame or ſome ſuch like.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. So <hi>Horace</hi> intending to prove that no Men were content <hi>with their Lots,</hi> after he had affirmed that neither Merchant, Knight nor Husbandman, nor Lawyer were content with their Lots, he ſumms up all in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> that Inſtances of this kind are ſo numerous, that it would <hi>weary even the Talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Fabius, <hi>to recite them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. An Induction <hi>is everted, when an unlike Example can be given, and that is termed an Inſtance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>For Example;</hi> If any one ſhould collect that any part of the Body ſhould be cut off if ſo ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as that there ſhould be no hopes of its Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and there were Danger that the whole ſhould be infected by it, becauſe the Foot, the Hand, the Ear in ſuch a Caſe is to be cut off, it may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that in the reſt of the Parts omitted there is another Ratio: For it would be a Ridiculous thing to cut off the Head for the Preſervation of the reſt of the Body; and if mention had been made alſo of the Head in the Induction, no body would have granted that that Part, tho' evilly affected, ſhould have been cut off. And thus much of Induction or a Syllogiſm of Induction.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:56895:105"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. A Syllogiſm farther may be divided <hi>into Perfect and Imperfect.</hi> A Perfect is that in which nothing is wanting.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. An Imperfect, in which there <hi>is ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,</hi> as the Enthymeme; <hi>or ſome Part of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as,</hi> Example.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. An Enthymeme, <hi>ſays Ariſtotle,</hi> is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Syllogiſm, Example, Induction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. An Enthymeme is a Syllogiſm maimed or mutilated, of one Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. And therefore conſiſts of <hi>two,</hi> of which the former is called <hi>the Antecedent, the latter the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 12. Now if the Subject <hi>of the Conſequent be</hi> put into the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> the Major is ſuppreſs'd; <hi>if the Predicate,</hi> the Minor; <hi>whether the one or the other,</hi> the Enthymeme may be reduc'd to a Categorical, <hi>by adding the Propoſition wanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. If neither the Subject, nor Predicate of the Conſequent, be in the Antecedent, <hi>the Major is ſuppreſs'd;</hi> and that being <hi>added,</hi> the Enthymeme is reduc'd <hi>to an Hypothetical Syllogiſm,</hi> or Syllogiſm <hi>of Suppoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now this Mode of Arguing or Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is ſo call'd from a <hi>Greek</hi> Word, ſignifying <hi>to think;</hi> becauſe one of the Propoſitions <hi>is expreſs'd and the other not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Enthymeme, for Example,</p>
                  <p>A Covetous Man <hi>wants;</hi> therefore a Covetous Man <hi>is not rich;</hi> the Subject of <hi>the Conſequent, is put into the Antecedent,</hi> from whence it is to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, <hi>that the Major is wanting;</hi> which being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it will be a full Syllogiſm in this manner. No Rich Man <hi>wants;</hi> Every Covetous Man <hi>wants:</hi> And therefore no Covetous Man <hi>is Rich.</hi> But let us fee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: He that <hi>ſins not,</hi> is not the Author of <hi>Sin:</hi> And therefore God is not the <hi>Author of Sin.</hi> Here the <hi>Predicate of the Conſequent</hi> is expreſſed in the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56895:105"/>and therefore the <hi>Minor is wanting;</hi> which being added, it will be ſuch a Syllogiſm as this: He that does not <hi>ſin,</hi> is not the Author of <hi>Sin:</hi> God does <hi>not ſin:</hi> And therefore God is not the <hi>Author of Sin,</hi> &amp;c. Add a Third to theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Virtue <hi>makes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py:</hi> And therefore Vice <hi>miſerable.</hi> Here neither the Subject nor the Predicate <hi>of the Conſequent is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in the Antecedent:</hi> And therefore the Major is <hi>wanting,</hi> which <hi>being added,</hi> it will make an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothetical <hi>Syllogiſm in this manner,</hi> viz. If Virtue makes happy, then Vice makes miſerable: But Virtue makes happy: And therefore <hi>Vice makes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 14. Now an Example is, when one Extreme is ſhewn to be in the Medium by the Reſemblance which it has to the other Extreme.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>That is,</hi> when the Major Extreme or the Predicate is collected to be in the Medium by ſome Example, which is like unto the <hi>Third, that is, the Subject.</hi> For Example conſiſts in <hi>four Terms,</hi> out of which are made <hi>two Ratiocinations;</hi> one Perfect, in which out of a Univerſal Major is <hi>collected ſome Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular;</hi> the other Imperfect, in which out of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular like to the Subject <hi>of the Concluſion brought, is collected a Propoſition Univerſal</hi> containing the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of both <hi>Particulars,</hi> and was the Major of the Firſt Ratiocination. For Example; Let the greater Extreme be this; <hi>It is Pernicious;</hi> The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium, <hi>To wage War upon our Neighbours;</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>The</hi> Athenians <hi>wage War upon the</hi> Thebans; The Simile, <hi>The</hi> Thebans <hi>wage War upon the</hi> Phocenſes, <hi>or Citizens of</hi> Phoce <hi>in</hi> Boeotia. Of the which we may make <hi>this like</hi> Argumentation Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary. To wage War <hi>upon Neighbburs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious;</hi> but if the <hi>Athenians</hi> infer or wage War upon the <hi>Thebans, they wage War upon Neighbours;</hi> and therefore if the <hi>Athenians</hi> wage War upon <hi>the</hi> Thebans <hi>it is pernicious.</hi> Add we to this Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiocination
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56895:106"/>
                     <hi>ſome Example;</hi> and by that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <hi>the Major Propoſition,</hi> viz. that it proved pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>to the</hi> Thebans their waging War with the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes,</hi> or Citizens of <hi>Phoce:</hi> But that was <hi>waging War upon Neighbours;</hi> and therefore to wage War upon <hi>Neighbours is pernicious.</hi> Here now is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>the Predicate of the Medium</hi> by ſomething which is like <hi>unto the Subject of the Preceding Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. §. Now indeed an Example does not <hi>neceſſarily</hi> conclude; becauſe it proceeds from a <hi>Particular to a Univerſal:</hi> It perſuades yet and begets Opinion, and that upon this <hi>Foundation,</hi> viz. That the like ſhould agree to the like, <hi>is meet and reaſonable.</hi> In fine, it perſuades, <hi>if examined,</hi> that the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um agrees with the Subject, as here, <hi>viz.</hi> that for the <hi>Athenians to wage War upon the</hi> Thebans <hi>was for them to wage War upon their Neighbours,</hi> and that the Predicate agrees to that which is <hi>like unto it,</hi> viz. that it was pernicious to <hi>the</hi> Thebans to wage War <hi>upon the</hi> Phocenſes. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo we come to the Twelfth Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> that of,</p>

                     <p n="1">1. §. To declare this by Example, let our Queſtion be, <hi>Do Stones live?</hi> You deny that they do.

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. NOW to the Invention or finding out of Probable or Dialectical Arguments <hi>belong Place and Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. <hi>A Rule a Canon, or Propoſition containing the Reaſon of the Conſequence of Dialectical Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. The Diſtribution of the Arguments here to be uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> in Dialectical Diſputations, is uſually into <hi>Artificial and Inartificial;</hi> that is, into thoſe <hi>of Art,</hi> to be drawn from the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Parts of the Queſtion, <hi>and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> which are to be found without. Now the firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. Are to be uſed for the Confirming or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felling of all ſorts of Problemes <hi>alike; that is, in the ſame manner, being no other than Teſtimonies; But the Artificial not, but may be ſaid to be of two</hi> ſorts; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe for the Confirming and Refelling of Notional, and thoſe for Confirming and Refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of ſuch as we have call'd real Problemes, becauſe concerned about real things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. Now thoſe of the firſt kind, <hi>viz.</hi> for the Confirming and Refelling of Notional Problemes, are always taken from the Nature or Propriety of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56895:114"/>that Affection or 2d Notion, concerning which it is query'd in the Probleme.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Which, or elſe ſome Canon belonging to it being placed in the Major, an Aſſumption being made, the controverted Affection is prov'd to be in the Subject; as becauſe Air is the Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wind, we prove it not to be its Genus; and becauſe Immortality is the Affection of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, we prove it not to be its Genus; both which Arguments <hi>lean upon this Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>That that which is the Subject or Propriety of a thing, cannot be its Genus,</hi> &amp;c. given us <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. of the firſt Book. And ſo Divines make it appear, that good Works <hi>are not to be the Cauſe of our Juſtification; becauſe every cauſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Effect; But good Works are after our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore not its Cauſe.</hi> And this Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation leans upon this Foundation, <hi>Theoreme</hi> 3. Cap. 15. <hi>of the firſt Book, viz That every Cauſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Cauſed in Nature and Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. Such Syllogiſms as theſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Poſt.</hi> Cap. 8. <hi>Syllogiſms Logical, that is, Notional; and the Uſe of them is very great in all Diſcipline.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. Arguments of the other ſort, <hi>viz.</hi> for Proving or Refelling <hi>of real Problemes, are always taken from the Affections belonging to the Nature of the Subject or Predicate, as from their Places.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. Of which thoſe are the beſt, which are <hi>taken from the Nature of the Predicate; becauſe not ſought whether the Subject be, but Predicate; or whether the Predicate be in the Subject or not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now for Examples of them both, ſuppoſe any one ſhould undertake to prove that a thing <hi>was not mutual or reciprocal, becauſe not</hi> de meo, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>that is,</hi> from mine, thine: The Argument <hi>wou'd then be taken from the Notation of the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate:</hi> But if that Logick is an Art directing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>becauſe ſo call'd from</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 15. <hi>Of thoſe from the Name there are two Places,</hi> viz. <hi>Notation and Conjugates.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. AND firſt of thoſe belonging to the Place of Notation or Etymology; and this has two Canons, and firſt, <hi>that to which convenes the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymology, to that alſo the Name; and that to which the Etymology, not</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to that neither the Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. So one may conclude, <hi>ſervari fidem,</hi> that is, ones Faith is kept; <hi>quia fit quod dictum eſt;</hi> that is, we have perform'd what was promis'd; becauſe <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> ſeems to ſignifie as much as if one ſhould ſay, <hi>fit quod dictum eſt;</hi> that is, <hi>what is promiſed is perform'd,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo one may ſay that a thing <hi>is not mutual;</hi> becauſe not <hi>de meo, tuum,</hi> that is, from mine, thine, as we have obſerv'd before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. The Second is that to which the Name belongs, to that alſo <hi>the Etymology; but not on the contrary;</hi> that is, he to whom the Name belongs, to him, the Etymology: But to him to whom the Etymology (unleſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a thorough Senſe) not always the Name. As for Inſtance, to take the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour's Example; <hi>He that is a prudent Man, to be ſure, preſerves Prudence;</hi> and that in the general or major Part of his Life. But he that preſerves Prudence, (unleſs in the general or major Part of his

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. The next Place to this is <hi>that of Conjugates; and that has three Canons;</hi> and the firſt is that to which one Conjugate agrees, to that alſo the other: And that to which one not, to that neither the other. An Inſtance of which is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. That of <hi>Mitio in</hi> Terence: <hi>viz. Man I am; and therefore I think nothing Human foreign from me. So in the Joques upon</hi> Caeſar <hi>in</hi> Suetonius, it is concluded, Bibulus <hi>was not Conſul; becauſe he conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not the Republick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Words are theſe:
<q>Non <hi>Bibulo</hi> quicquam nuper, ſed <hi>Caeſare</hi> factum eſt: Nam <hi>Bibulo</hi> fieri Conſule nil memini.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>That is,
<q>Nothing has been done lately by <hi>Bibulus,</hi> but <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:</hi> For in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Bibulus</hi> I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing to have been done.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Uſe of which Canon, this Caution only is <hi>to be uſed,</hi> viz. that a <hi>Conjugate only in Word, and not Affinity of Nature, be not joyned:</hi> For in <hi>thoſe of which one ſignifies a Natural Power or Habit, and the other an Action, the Illation will be very fallacious:</hi> For it does not follow he has <hi>the Faculty of Seeing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſees or he is drunk, and therefore a Drunkard: Or does juſt things; and therefore he is juſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſo in other the like Caſes or Inſtances</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. The Second is, of Conjugates; <hi>Conjugates are Conſequent;</hi> That is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As if one ſhould argue in this manner: Logick does thoſe things that are govern'd by Rules of Art; And therefore Logick is an Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56895:116"/>But here 'tis to be <hi>heeded, leſt from Concretes by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident predicated of one another, it be collected alſo, that Abſtracts are predicated of one another: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſomething is ſweet, which is White, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Milk,</hi> It does not follow <hi>that ſome Sweetneſs is Whitneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. The Third is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>the Conjugates of Contraries, are amongſt themſelves Contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>As if Health and Sickneſs are Contraries; then, to be in Health, and ſick, muſt be Contraries too.</hi> And theſe Rules <hi>(if in this manner limited)</hi> do ſeldom fail.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. The Place from Definition has theſe two Canons; and firſt <hi>that to which agrees the Definition to that alſo the Defined. And that to which not the Definition, to that neither the Defined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As if one ſhould prove that Logick was an <hi>Art, becauſe a Habit Effective with true Reaſon; or not to be a Science, becauſe not a certain Knowledge of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing by its next Cauſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. Secondly, That which agrees to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition, that alſo agrees to the Defined, and that which not to the Definition, that neither to the Deſined: As if one ſhould argue thus,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>He who, is wont to keep a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in all things is happy:</hi> A good Man <hi>is wont to keep a Mediocrity in all things,</hi> and a wicked Man not: <hi>And therefore a Good is happy, and a Wicked Man not,</hi> &amp;c. But here Heed is to be taken, that that which is ſaid <hi>of the Definition as a Definition, be not ſaid of the Defined: As, in this Syllogiſm,</hi> viz. Animal, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, <hi>are two Words; Man is an Animal, Rational: And therefore Man is two Words.</hi> But in other Caſes Canons from Deſinition are <hi>moſt certain,</hi> provided <hi>you take Reciprocate Definitions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. The Place from the <hi>Genus has two Canons;</hi> and the Firſt is that which is <hi>Univerſally Affirmed of the Genus, that is alſo of the Species,</hi> and that which
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56895:117"/>is Univerſally denyed <hi>of the Genus, that alſo of the Species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. So you may prove <hi>the Sight may err;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Senſe may <hi>err:</hi> And Juſtice not to <hi>be by Nature; becauſe no Virtue is by Nature,</hi> &amp;c. But in this Canon it is to be heeded, leſt that which is <hi>ſaid Accidentally of the Genus, and not according to its Eſſence, be in another Acceptation taken of the Species;</hi> As if any one ſhould argue in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>viz. Animal is a Genus or Triſſylable; Man is an Animal: And therefore Man is a Genus or Triſſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. Secondly, <hi>Taking away the Genus, you take away the Species;</hi> or that from which you take away the Genus, you take away alſo the Species.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As if to prove that the Senſe were not Science. one ſhould ſay it was not a Habit, becauſe if not a Habit, it cannot be a Science; ſince there is no Science but what is a Habit; that is, but what is comprehended under that Genus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Canons from hence, obſerving the Cautions above-given, are always very certain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. The next Place is that of the Species, which has <hi>three Canons: Firſt, ſuppoſing the Species, you ſuppoſe alſo the Genus;</hi> or that to which the Species is attributed, to that alſo the Genus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. And ſo it may be concluded, <hi>that Logick is an Habit, becauſe it is an Art,</hi> which is a Species of Habit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. Secondly, <hi>The Species's being all taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Genus is alſo taken away: or that from which all the Species's are taken away, from that alſo the Genus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As Friendſhip <hi>is not Fortitude, or Temperance, or Juſtice, or Prudence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore not a Virtue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And ſuch an Argumentation as this is a Syllogiſm of numeration of Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:56895:117"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 12. Thirdly, <hi>That which to all the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies's, that alſo to the Genus; and that which to none that neither to the Genus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. And this Canon is the Foundation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as well the <hi>Affirmed as Denyed;</hi> Of which we have entreated in its proper Place; to which Recourſe may be had, if the Reader ſhall ſo think fit, for Examples. Now all the Canons of this Place are very faithful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. The Place from the whole has two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; and firſt, the whole being poſited, all the Principal Parts are ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Or that to which the whole is attributed, to that alſo all the Principal Parts; as, to <hi>Sempronius</hi> there was Maintenance given; <hi>and therefore Clothes, Victuals, and Habitation,</hi> &amp;c. I ſaid the the Principal, becauſe the Whole being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that every the leaſt Part that tends to the Integrity, not Eſſence of it, ſhould be ſo, is <hi>not neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 14. Secondly, <hi>That which agrees to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Whole, that alſo to the Singular Parts of it; and that which not to ſuch a Whole, that neither to any Part of it.</hi> As for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Water by its own Nature is moiſt, and therefore every Drop of <hi>it is moiſt. The Heaven</hi> is not Corruptible; and therefore <hi>not the Stars,</hi> &amp;c. Here we are to take heed, leſt what is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted <hi>to the Whole as Whole,</hi> be not alſo attributed to the <hi>Part.</hi> For not becauſe there is Water eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where <hi>about the Earth, does it follow that every Drop of it is every where about the Earth,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Canons of this Place <hi>are very Certain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 15. The Place from Parts <hi>has four Canons:</hi> And firſt, all the Parts being poſited and joyned, the Whole muſt be alſo poſited too: As for Inſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Caeſar <hi>occupied</hi> Belgium, <hi>and</hi> Aquitaine, <hi>and</hi> Celtica, <hi>and therefore all</hi> Gallia: <hi>I ſaid united, becauſe</hi> poſiting all the Parts of a Whole, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56895:118"/>thoſe Parts not united, the Whole is not yet poſited. As for Inſtance; a Houſe, which, you know till the Materials are joyned, as well as provided, becomes not a Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 16. <hi>The Second is taking away the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Part, you take away alſo the Whole.</hi> As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Infants are deſtitute of the Knowledge, <hi>of Chriſt, and therefore of Faith.</hi> I ſaid the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts, becauſe <hi>the Hand taken away,</hi> the Man does <hi>not die, but becomes only lame:</hi> but let it be the Head, or the other Principal Part, and <hi>he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally expires,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 17. Thirdly, <hi>That which agrees to all the Parts; that alſo to the Whole: And that which to none, that neither to the Whole,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As for Inſtance; the Law, Prophets, Goſpels, with the Writings of the Holy Apoſtles, are all Divinely inſpir'd: And therefore the whole Scripture is Divinely inſpir'd: The Walls, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, Beams, Rafters, Roof of the Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſeem not to be old: And therefore the Houſe ſeems not to be old, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 19. Fourthly, <hi>That which agrees to a ſimilar Part, that alſo to the Whole; and that which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees not to the ſimilar Part, that neither to the Whole.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As for Inſtance; Every Drop of Water is moiſt: And therefore the Water it ſelf is ſo. The Stars are incorruptible: And therefore the Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here one is to take Care, that that which agrees, to the ſimilar Part <hi>only by ſome External Cauſe, and not the Condition of its proper Nature, be not Concluded of the Whole.</hi> For it does not follow from every Drop of Water's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round that the whole Element is ſo. For beſides that no Element, <hi>beſides the Earth, is of any determinate Figure,</hi> even <hi>the Rotundity of the Drops does not proceed from the Nature of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:56895:118"/>but the Paucity of their Matter, by which it comes to paſs that they cannot flow.</hi> In other Caſes <hi>the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of this Place are very certain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 19. The Place <hi>from the Cauſes in general has this Canon,</hi> viz. that the Cauſe being Actually put, it is <hi>neceſſary that the Cauſed ſhould be ſo too: And ſo</hi> Vice versà.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Cauſe in <hi>Act is ſaid to be that which Cauſes or Exerciſes its Office and Cauſality.</hi> Now it would imply a Contradiction for one to ſay, that the Cauſe cauſes, and yet that the Cauſed is not Cauſed; as for Example, That the Workmen are Building, and yet that the Houſe is not; or that the Houſe is a Building, and yet that there are no Workmen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 20. The Place from Matter has two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; and firſt, the Matter being taken away, the Compoſed, and alſo its Material Form are ſo.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, if you ſhould prove, where there is no Wood, there can be no Ships; or becauſe <hi>Stones have no Organical Body, neither can they have a Soul. I ſaid Material Form, becauſe Immaterial, ſuch as is the Humane Soul by taking away the Matter, cannot be taken away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 21. Secondly, <hi>Such as is the Matter, ſuch is alſo the Compoſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As the Statue is of Worm-eaten, or rotten Wood; and therefore it ſelf alſo is ſo. This Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non takes Place only <hi>in Things made of Art: For in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things it will be fallacious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 22. The Place from Form <hi>has this Canon,</hi> viz. Poſiting the Form; the Compoſed alſo is poſted, and that taken away, the Compoſed is alſo taken away.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, the Pigmies <hi>have a Rational Soul, and</hi> therefore <hi>they are Men:</hi> The Stars have <hi>not a Soul; and therefore they do not live.</hi> This Canon is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther irrefragable, <hi>provided the firſt Part be underſtood
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56895:119"/>of Material Form:</hi> For, <hi>poſiting the Rational Soul, that the Man ſhould be ſo too, is not neceſſary: but yet this,</hi> viz. <hi>That he ſhould be a Man if he has a Rational Soul, is requiſite and neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 23. Place from Efficient has two Canons; and the firſt of them is, <hi>Such as the Cauſe is, ſuch is the Effect,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>And thus God is very good; and therefore his Works are ſo.</hi> This Canon is deceitful, unleſs cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly uſed: <hi>For firſt it ſails in Cauſes that are by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident.</hi> For neither does it follow, that a Son is good, <hi>becauſe his Father is ſo; nor yet bad:</hi> For a Son is <hi>not produc'd by his Father as he is good or bad, but as he is a Man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>And ſo it fails in Equivocal Cauſes: For it does not follow that the Sun is animated, although it <hi>animates the World; nor that the Whetſtone is ſharp, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſharpens Iron.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>in Cauſes Voluntary, when making uſe of their utmoſt Endeavours, they do ſomething which does not correſpond to their Skill or Art, As when a Painter paints leſs elegantly than becomes his Art,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 24 Secondly, <hi>That which is the Cauſe of the Cauſe, is alſo the Cauſe of the Cauſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As Virtue is partly from Nature, partly from Inſtitution, partly from Cuſtom: <hi>Virtue is the Cauſe of civil Happineſs: And therefore civil Happineſs is partly from Nature, partly from Inſtitution, partly from Cuſtom,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Canon has Place only in Cauſes Subordinate of themſelves:</hi> For in Cauſes <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate by Accident, it for the moſt part fails.</hi> For it does not follow, becauſe God is the Cauſe <hi>of our Will, and our Will is the Cauſe of Sin, that therefore God is the Cauſe of Sin.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 25. Place from the End <hi>has this Canon,</hi> viz. <hi>That the End being put, there are alſo put the Means to that End.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:56895:119"/>1. §. And ſo <hi>Ovid</hi> concludes that Man was made with an upright Countenance; becauſe to contemplate the Heavens; deeming that to be the End of an upright Figure.</p>
                  <p>The Words of the ſweet Poet are theſe,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Omnia cùm ſpectent Animalia caetera Terram,</hi>
                        </l>

                           <hi>Os homini ſublime dedit, Caelùmque tueri</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Juſſit; &amp; erectos ad ſydera tollere Vultus.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q> Which admirable Pare-Royal may be rendred in theſe two ſorry Couplets in this manner,
<q>
                        <l>And whereas other Animals behold</l>
                        <l>With down-caſt Looks this Sublunary Mold;</l>
                        <l>To Man he gave a ſtately upright Frame,</l>
                        <l>And bad him view thoſe Heav'ns from whence he came.</l>
                     </q> Which tho' they fail as to their Verſifcation, yet may they ſerve to ſhew <hi>in ſome</hi> meaſure the Meaning of that memorable Paſſage of excellent <hi>Ovid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now the Means <hi>are often expreſs'd by a Negation of thoſe things which impede the End:</hi> As, the Pupil or Apple of the Eye, <hi>is to admit all Colours; and therefore to be without Colour.</hi> The Elect muſt <hi>be ſaved; And, therefore, muſt not Sin unto Death,</hi> &amp;c. But now tho' the End being put, it is neceſſary that the Means ſhould be ſo; yet that the End not being put, they ſhould not be ſo, is not always neceſſary: For it is not neceſſary that a Man ſhould be deſtitute of Books and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, becauſe <hi>he is not Learned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 26. Now the Place from Cauſed <hi>has four Canons:</hi> And the firſt is, the Compoſed poſited, the Matter and Form muſt be ſo too: And when that's taken away, the Material Form alſo muſt be taken away.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:56895:120"/>1. §. And ſo Plants are living things; And <hi>therefore they muſt have a Body and Soul:</hi> And Stones are not; And therefore <hi>they muſt not have a Soul.</hi> I ſaid Form Material: For that the Compoſed taken away, the Matter ſhould be ſo too: Or the Form Immaterial, is not neceſſary: For it does not follow, that there is no Iron, becauſe no Sword: or that the Soul of Man is not, becauſe he dies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 27. Secondly, The Effect being poſited, it <hi>follows that either there is a Cauſe Efficient, or elſe, that there has been one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, there is a Building; and therefore there is, or was an Architect to build it. Here are the Footſteps; and therefore this Way, in all likelihood there has paſſed ſome Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 28. Thirdly, <hi>Such as is the Effect, ſuch is the Cauſe that produc'd it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, this Picture is fine; and therefore ſo muſt the Artiſt be that drew it. To this are to be added, the ſame Limitations which were added <hi>to the firſt of the Place from Cauſe Efficient,</hi> viz the Cautions againſt Accidentals and Aequivocals, <hi>becauſe in theſe Caſes this Rule may fail us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 29. Fourthly, The Means taken away, the End muſt alſo be ſo too.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>As, Stones are not nouriſhed; and therefore they do not live. Many Men the Goſpel will not be Preached to; and therefore many Men by means of the Goſpel will not be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 30. The Place from the Subject has this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Subject being poſited, the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety muſt alſo be ſo too; and that taken away, the <hi>Propriety muſt alſo be ſo too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, <hi>Chriſt is God; and therefore he has the Power to forgive Sins. The Writings of the Fathers are not the Word of God; and therefore they are not of Divine Authority,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe Canons without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Limitation, are certain and firm.</p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:56895:120"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 31. The Place for Adjuncts <hi>is of great Extent, and has under it Proprieties, Objects, Signs and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</hi> Now,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 32. The Place from Proprieties <hi>has two Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;</hi> and firſt, that to which the Propriety is given, to that alſo the Subject; And that to which the <hi>Propriety is not given, to that neither the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, <hi>Chriſt is Omniſcient; and therefore he is God. Angels fill up no Place; and therefore they have not Bodies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 33. <hi>The Second is, that which is ſaid of the Propriety, may be alſo ſaid of the Subject: And that which cannot be ſaid of the Propriety, that neither of the Subject,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, a Talkative Perſon is to be avoided; and therefore <hi>a Buſie-Body, or one that is inquiſitive into other Peoples Matters. A wiſe Man is not to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon things of a Fleeting and Tranſitory Nature; and therefore not upon Riches or other Earthly Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, or Goods,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax,</hi> 34. <hi>The Place from Object in the ſecond Place has this Canon,</hi> viz. That that to which <hi>the Object is given, to that alſo the Subject; and that to which the Object is not, to that neither the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, <hi>The Doctrine of fallacious Sophiſms di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the Mind towards the Knowledge of things; and therefore is a Part of Logick. Logick has not things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its Object; and therefore is not Science,</hi> &amp;c. The Arguments of this Place are very firm, if drawn from proper Objects; but otherwiſe only <hi>Probable:</hi> As, if one ſhould ſay thus; <hi>He talks of Military Affairs; and therefore he is a Soldier: Of Laws; and therefore he is a Lawyer. Her Delight is not in Womens Company; and therefore ſhe is not a Woman,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:56895:121"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 35. <hi>Place from Sign has this Canon,</hi> viz. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the Sign,</hi> viz. <hi>Antecedent, Conſequent, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, the thing ſigned is alſo poſited; and that taken away, the thing ſigned alſo is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. As, it is Day; <hi>and therefore the Sun will riſe. The Woman longs; and therefore ſhe has conceiv'd. The Man flyes; and therefore he is guilty of the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Conſpiracy. It is not Full-Moon; and therefore there can be no Eclipſe,</hi> &amp;c. Now Arguments drawn from this Place alſo are firm, when the Signs are neceſſary and proper to the thing ſigned; otherwiſe they are only probable: <hi>As, he was not</hi> Semproni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us<hi>'s Enemy; and therefore he kill'd him not. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man does not love the Boy; and therefore ſhe is not his Mother,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore it is that the Philoſophers make uſe of theſe ſo much the more ſparingly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 36. The Place from Circumſtance, laſtly, has <hi>this Canon,</hi> viz. <hi>poſiting the Circumſtance of the thing you poſit the thing it ſelf; and taking that away, you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo take away the thing it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. <hi>As, he has ſtolen ſomething out of a ſacred Place; and therefore he is Sacrilegious. The Spring comes on; and therefore Flowers will be found. He goes covered with a</hi> Cowle or Hood, after the manner of the <hi>Monks; and therefore he is a</hi> Monk. <hi>Chriſt was to be born in the time of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Polity, and that at</hi> Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them; <hi>which Polity is not now in being, as likewiſe</hi> Bethlehem: <hi>And therefore Chriſt is not now to be born</hi> (as believe the unconverted <hi>Jews) but is ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>already. He is not in Mourning; and therefore he mourns not,</hi> &amp;c. Arguments alſo from this Place are Part firm, and Part probable; and Uſe will be the only means to diſtinguiſh betwixt them. And now we come to treat of <hi>the Canons belonging to Places Diſſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, Compared and Teſtimonies.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. §.

Secondly, that which is contain'd under the better Genus or Species, that alſo its ſelf is better; and ſo becauſe <hi>a living thing is better than a not; a Fly will be better than the Heavent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, From the Whole and Part we have theſe; as, firſt, if the whole Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or whole conſiſting of Parts of the ſame Name and Nature be more ſo than ſuch a Whole, then its Part will be more ſo than ſuch a Part; and, conrariwiſe; as, <hi>If Gold be heavier than Braſs, then it will follow, that every Part of Gold, obſerving the ſame Proportion of Magnitude will be heavier than the like Quantity of Braſs,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, that which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56895:126"/>is abſolutely ſuch, or effects any thing as ſuch, its Whole will be more ſuch, and Effect, that any thing elſe be more ſuch than its Part; and ſo, <hi>if Rhubarb have a Power of Purging Choler, then a Drachm will have a greater Power than has a Scruple; becauſe it is but the third Part of a Drachm,</hi> &amp;c. Under which general Maxim are contain'd ſeveral ſpecial; as, firſt, many Goods are to be preferr'd before fewer; and ſo Virtue with Nobility, is to be preferr'd before Virtue alone. Secondly, that which is Honeſt, Pleaſant and Profitable, will be beyond that which is only Honeſt, Pleaſant, or Profitable. Thirdly, that which encreaſes or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhes Good by its Abceſs or Acceſs, is better than that which neither encreaſes nor diminiſhes Good by its Abceſs or Acceſs. Fourthly, by how much more it encreaſes or diminiſhes Good by its Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or Acceſs, by ſo much is it better than any other thing, than the which it is better in this Reſpect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fifthly, from Matter and Form in the next Place, we have theſe; and firſt, that, whoſe Matter is more ſo, that alſo it ſelf is more ſo. <hi>So becauſe Gold is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more durable than Stone,</hi> it follows, that a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Statue is better and more durable than a Stone, one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, that which has a Nobler Form, that it ſelf is alſo Nobler. <hi>So becauſe the Form of Man is better than that of Beaſts; becauſe this is Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and Immortal, and that Material and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, it follows, that Man is better than Beaſts,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, From the Cauſe Efficient theſe; and firſt that which by it ſelf, ſimply, and by its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>is ſuch,</hi> is more ſo than that which by Accident is ſuch, or in ſome reſpect, or by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation: <hi>And ſo Meat as Meat is wholeſomer than Phyſick; becauſe that of it ſelf is ſo, and this only by Accident; and Light is more Profitable than Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; becauſe that is uſeful to</hi> all, <hi>this only to Thieves, and ſuch as will abſcond. Laſtly, the Sun is more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did than the Moon; becauſe that ſhines of its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56895:127"/>this only by Participation,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, that which of it ſelf and by its own Nature is more ſuch, that effects more; <hi>and ſo on the Contrary.</hi> So Fire heats more than Water, <hi>when it is warm'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hotter.</hi> So, you know Iron to be heavier than Wood, becauſe it more ſwiftly deſcends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Canon can be uſed only in Cauſes of them ſelves: For in Cauſes by Accident it fails often. For Iron red-hot, altho' not hotter than Flame, burns yet more vehemently, the Denſity of its Matter aſſiſting it, and impreſſing the Heat more ſtrongly upon the Patient; and ſo in other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the like Nature. Thirdly, that to which the Cauſe agrees moſt, to that alſo the Effect; <hi>and ſo on the Contrary. So you may prove Old Men to be more Prudent than Young; becauſe they have more Experience in Things.</hi> Fourthly, that by which any thing is ſuch, that it ſelf alſo muſt be more ſuch. And ſo, becauſe Water grows <hi>Warm by Fire, it may be collected, that the Fire is more Hot than it.</hi> But this Canon in ſome Caſes will fail us. And firſt in Cauſes by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and Aequivocal: For it does not follow, that becauſe ſome one is drunk by Wine, that therefore Wine ſhould be more drunk; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Knife is ſharpen'd by the Stone, that therefore the Stone ſhould be ſharper than the Knife. Secondly, in Effects, which receive not more or leſs: As, if you ſhould prove the Father to be more a Man than his Son; becauſe the Son is ſo by his Means. Thirdly, thoſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon one Cauſe: For although the Scholar derive his Learning from his Maſter, yet it does not follow that the Maſter muſt be always Learneder than the Scholar: For it may be, that the Scholar may have more Ingeny and Induſtry than his Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, thoſe whoſe Operation, Work or Effect, or Uſe is the beſt, thoſe things themſelves are the beſt; and by
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56895:127"/>how much they are the better, by ſo much are they the better; And ſo the Mind than the Senſe, becauſe the Operation of this is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Architectonical Art than the Shooe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, becauſe a Houſe is better than a Shooe, and Virtue than Riches; becauſe the Uſe of this belongs to the Soul, and of thoſe to the Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Ninthly, From the End and Means theſe: And firſt that to which more agrees the End, to that more agrees the Means; <hi>and ſo on the Contrary.</hi> So you may prove any one has more Ingeny, Books, Leiſure, Induſtry, becauſe he is more Learned; or more Learned, becauſe more Ingeny, Leiſure, Induſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Secondly, the End is better than its Means; as <hi>Health than Phyſick.</hi> Add to this another; and that is, That which for its own ſake is deſirable, is better than that which for another's; <hi>or alſo that whick for the Sake of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Oſtentation.</hi> So you <hi>prove that Learning is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>tter than a Library; Friends than Riches; Health than Beauty,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly that which approaches nearer to the End is better than that which is farther off. So the Art of Commanding is better than that of Horſemanſhip; becauſe <hi>approaching nearer to the Victory.</hi> Fourthly, that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the better End, that it ſelf is the better. So <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> makes good, <hi>That Wiſdom is better than Virtue Moral; becauſe leading to the ſpeculative Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which, he ſays, is ſo much better than the Practical, by how much Eternal are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Periſhing Things.</hi> Book 10. Ethick. <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</p>
                     <p>Tenthly, From the Subject and Adjunct; and firſt, <hi>That which is in the Nobler Subject; that, if good, is better; and if bad, worſer than that which is in an Ignobler.</hi> So Virtue is better <hi>than Health, and Vices worſe than Diſeaſes; becauſe the Mind is Nobler than the Body.</hi> Secondly, that from which the Subject is
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56895:128"/>Denominated Good, is better than that from which not. <hi>So a Good that's Honeſt, is better than that which is Profitable; becauſe from that we are named Good, and from this not,</hi> &amp;c. Thirdly, of thoſe, both which make the Subject good, that is the beſt, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it with the moſt Goodneſs. <hi>So Virtues Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical,</hi> viz. <hi>Faith, Hope and Charity,</hi> are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before Civil. Fourthly, that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about the beſt Object, that it ſelf alſo is the beſt. <hi>So Philoſophy is better than Medicine; becauſe that's about the Mind, this only the Body.</hi> Fifthly, that is beſt from which follows the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Good or leaſt Evil; and upon this Account it is <hi>Cicero</hi> prefers <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>of his Offices,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of <hi>Solon,</hi> by which the <hi>Areopagites were ſet up, before the Victory of</hi> Themiſtocles, <hi>at</hi> Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis; <hi>becauſe that but once profited, this would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways profitable to the Common-Wealth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. From the Diſparates, this, <hi>viz.</hi> When of Two we deny the One to be in us, that ſo we may aſſume to our ſelves the Other, that we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem to be beſt which we would have ſeem to be in us. So becauſe for the moſt Part People deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>be Laborious that they might ſeem Ingenious, it ſhews that to be Ingenious they eſteem better than to be Laborious,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. From the Contraries, theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that which recedes the farther from its Contrary, that is, more ſo. <hi>So that is whiter which has the leaſt Mixture of Blackneſs.</hi> Secondly, that whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is worſt, that it ſelf is beſt; and ſo on the Contrary. <hi>As if Improbity be worſe than Diſeaſes then Probity muſt be better than Health.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that whoſe Abſence, Deceaſe, or Loſs is worſe, that it ſelf is beſt; and ſo on the Contrary. <hi>As, if the Loſs of a good Eſtimation be worſe than that of Money, then a good Eſtimation is a greater Good than that of Money,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:56895:128"/>13. From Major, Minor, and Equal, theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, that which is more ſo than the greater, that is more ſo than the leſs. And <hi>Secondly,</hi> likewiſe if the leſs be more ſo, then ſo will the greater. So if Health is a greater Good than Riches, and Virtue be better than Health, then will it alſo be better than Riches. Thirdly, if one of the Equals be more ſo, then alſo will the other be more ſo. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and alſo that that which is more ſo than one of the Equals, that alſo will be more ſo than the other. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; If of two Weights equal, one be heavier or lighter than a Third, then alſo the other will be ſo, or if that third be heavier or light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than one of them, it will be alſo heavier or lighter than the other, <hi>&amp;c. Fifthly,</hi> if one Genus be more ſo than another, that which is in the moſt excellent will be more ſo than that which is in the leſs. <hi>As, if Science be better than Art, then the moſt Noble Science will be better than the moſt Noble Art.</hi> Sixthly, if an abſolute Predicate agree with an abſolute Subject <hi>of its own Nature,</hi> the Increaſe or Increment of the Predicate will agree with the Increaſe or Increment of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. <hi>As, if what is honeſt be good, that which is more ſo will be better, and moſt, beſt.</hi> I ſaid of its own <hi>Nature;</hi> becauſe if the Predicate agree not to the Subject in this manner, the Canon will deceive us: For it does not follow; <hi>becauſe the Exercitation of the Body is good, that therefore the more the better, and moſt, beſt;</hi> becauſe Exercitation is not <hi>of it ſelf, and in its own Nature good, but ſo far as it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. From like and unlike, this, <hi>viz.</hi> that which is moſt like to that which is ſuch; or more ſuch, that, alſo, it ſelf is more ſuch, and ſo on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. <hi>So</hi> Ajax <hi>is eſteemed to be more valiant than</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſſes; <hi>becauſe more like to</hi> Achilles, <hi>the moſt valiant of the</hi> Grecians. But here obſerve that the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56895:129"/>be inſtituted in its proper Genus: <hi>For it does not follow if any one be more like to</hi> Achilles <hi>in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that therefore he ſhould be more valiant; but only more wrathful,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. By Teſtimonies Problemes Comparate are to be confirmed after the ſame manner as are the Abſolute. <hi>For as by</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s Teſtimony it may be proved, that Covetouſneſs is an Evil, ſo may it alſo that it is worſe than Prodigality,</hi> &amp;c. So that for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons Comparate here in this Place there is no need, unleſs perchance for the Diſcernment of Authority of Teſtimonies this Canon ſhould be obſerved, <hi>viz. That what God ſays, is more credible than what Man; the Wiſe, than the Vulgar; more, than few; Skilful, than Unskilful; and what any one teſtifies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf, than what for himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. And theſe are the Comparate Canons, which contain the Deſignation of a certain Place, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Apertly or Hiddenly.</hi> In all which the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations are to be underſtood, which are added to the Abſolute Canons to which they anſwer. For Example; The firſt Canon Comparate from the Conjugates, anſwers to the firſt Abſolute Canon of the ſame Place, which <hi>is this.</hi> That to which one of the Conjugates agrees, to that alſo agrees the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To this Canon is added this Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> that there ſhould not be adhibited Conjugates joyned only in Affinity of <hi>Word, net Nature.</hi> This ſame Caution is to be added to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, which was thus declared. That to which agrees one of the Conjugates more, to that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agrees the other: And therefore as it does not follow, that this Man is Drunk; and therefore a Drunkard; ſo neither this, that this Man is more Drunk, and therefore more a Drunkard, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. There remain of Comparate Canons, which contain no Deſignation of <hi>any certain Place;</hi> of which many <hi>are extant</hi> Book 3. Top. Of which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56895:129"/>we have here ſelected the Principal: As, firſt, the more laſting and conſtant Goods are, the more to be choſen; As, <hi>the Goods of the Mind than thoſe of the Body.</hi> Secondly, any thing's then the more to be wiſh'd for, when more opportune and uſeful; As, <hi>fear in Youth, Prudence in older Age.</hi> Thirdly, that which always or often's of uſe, is better than that which ſeldom; As, <hi>Temperance than For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</hi> Fourthly, thoſe things which content one in themſelves, are more to be choſen than thoſe which need other things; As, <hi>Abundance of things than Money: For he that abounds in the laſt,</hi> viz. <hi>Money may want other things; But he that abounds in things, cannot want Money,</hi> &amp;c. Fifthly, that which is the more ſplendid, is the more to be wiſh'd for: <hi>So Glory, than Riches.</hi> Sixthly, difficult things are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe that are more facile. And Seventhly, Proper than Common. By Common here is not to be underſtood Publick, but only thoſe things which many have; by Proper, which we have alone, or in Common with but very few; For theſe are the things which we moſt love. Eightly, thoſe things which cannot be communicated to others, are more precious than thoſe which can; As, <hi>Knowledge than Riches.</hi> Ninthly, things not neceſſary are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before thoſe that are. <hi>So we chuſe rather to live Commodiouſly than to live.</hi> Which Canon is is not everted by <hi>Cicero,</hi> when in his Topicks he ſays, Things neceſſary are to be preferr'd before Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary: For by Unneceſſary he underſtands <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous.</hi> But to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Unneceſſaries ſignifie no more than thoſe which belong <hi>to the</hi> bene eſſe; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, the</hi> eſſe. Tenthly, thoſe things which cannot be given by others, are better than thoſe which may; As, <hi>Virtue and Learning than Riches,</hi> &amp;c. Eleventhly, that which one would have others leave one; As, <hi>Friends than Wealth:</hi> For Friends we would get to our ſelves; but Riches we had rather that others ſhould leave us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">
                        <pb n="98" facs="tcp:56895:130"/>18. And theſe are the Principal Canons by which Problemes <hi>compared</hi> are to be confirmed; which were to be drawn either from the Abſolute <hi>Canons or</hi> Ariſtotle<hi>'s three Books of Topicks.</hi> In all of which, eſpecially thoſe which contain a Compariſon of things in <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> this Caution is to be uſed, <hi>viz. That thoſe things which are compared, be in other things equal.</hi> For Example; <hi>The more laſting Goods are then to be preferr'd before the leſs, when in other things they are equal,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. THE Conditions which are to be obſerv'd <hi>in Demonſtration</hi> Why, <hi>are partly belonging to the Queſtion, partly to the Cauſe or Medium of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and partly to the Premiſſes or Principles;</hi> of which in the Chapter following.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. Every Queſtion does not admit of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration <hi>Why;</hi> but only <hi>that which is true, and has a certain and immutable Cauſe of its Truth.</hi>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. And <hi>therefore neither Propoſitions immediate, nor fortuitous can be demonſtrated; but only proper Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now Propoſitions immediate cannot; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have <hi>no Medium,</hi> or <hi>Cauſe of their Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Chance, likewiſe, <hi>cannot;</hi> becauſe they have not any Dependance upon any certain Cauſe, or <hi>Rule;</hi> Accidents therefore, and thoſe proper only can be demonſtrated. For Subſtances have no Cauſe why they're in the Subject; becauſe they are predicated, <hi>always as Genus's or Differences.</hi> And <hi>Accidents improper have no certain and definite Cauſe.</hi> Now whether theſe <hi>Accidents proper</hi> flow from the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Subject, or ſome External Cauſe, or <hi>whether they be perpetual, or only frequent, it matters not:</hi> But this, that they cohere with their Cauſes ſo as that they being put, theſe alſo be put, and that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56895:132"/>being taken away, theſe alſo may be taken away, is neceſſary and required. For Inſtance; Altho' the Moon be not always deficient, <hi>yet, that ſhe is ſo, when ſo, may be demonſtrated;</hi> becauſe ſhe is always ſo, when the Earth is <hi>Diametrically interpos'd between the Sun and the Moon; and never ſo when otherwiſe,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now whereas Cauſe is ſaid to be two Ways next, <hi>that is, either abſolutely or in its own Genus:</hi> In this Place is to be <hi>underſtood the Abſolutely next;</hi> that is, ſuch as that being put, the Effect alſo muſt be put; and that taken away, the Effect alſo muſt be taken away. And farther, it is required, <hi>that it be alſo the Cauſe of the Predicate: For, that it be alſo of the Subject, is not ſo neceſſary;</hi> becauſe it is not enquir'd, <hi>whether the Subject be; for that is pre-ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;</hi> but <hi>whether the Predicate, or in plainer Terms, whether the Predicate</hi> be <hi>in the Subject or not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56895:135"/>For in all Cauſes which enter Demonſtration, there is a certain Series and Subordination; ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Poſterior is the Effect <hi>of the Precedent.</hi> As of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten therefore as any Effect is demonſtrated by ſuch a Cauſe as is the Effect of a former Cauſe, that Minor muſt neceſſarily be <hi>Mediate;</hi> and then that Minor is to be reſolv'd into that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Cauſe; <hi>and ſo on</hi> till you come to the Firſt <hi>of that Series,</hi> which conſtitutes a Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both Propoſitions <hi>Immediate:</hi> And this Demonſtration is the Foundation of all the reſt <hi>which are of the ſame Series.</hi> And therefore, in ſearching of Science, we are to proceed from the firſt Demonſtration to the following in <hi>Synthetic Order;</hi> and then the Minor <hi>Mediate</hi> is eſteem'd as it were, <hi>Immediate; becauſe now before demonſtrated.</hi> For a Demonſtrated Propoſition is no leſs apt to beget Knowledge than a Propoſition <hi>Immediate and Indemonſtrable.</hi> But yet if any one ſhall happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>a Demonſtration,</hi> whoſe Minor is <hi>Mediate,</hi> he muſt proceed in <hi>Analytic Order</hi> towards the <hi>firſt and Fundamental Demonſtration.</hi> Nor will he firſt have attained <hi>Science,</hi> before he <hi>ſhall have arriv'd at the firſt Cauſe:</hi> For in this <hi>the Mind acquieſces.</hi> But let us add Examples, that the Thing may be ſo much the better underſtood: <hi>That which is endu'd with a Three-fold Dimenſion, admits not another Body to be with it at the ſame time, in the ſame Place: All Bodies are endu'd with a Three-fold Dimenſion: And therefore,</hi> &amp;c. The Minor of this Syllogiſm may be demonſtrated in this manner: <hi>That which conſiſts of Matter and Form is endued with a Three-fold Dimenſion; Every Body conſiſts of Matter and Form: And therefore every body,</hi> &amp;c. Now the Minor of this Syllogiſm <hi>is Immediate</hi> as well as the <hi>Major;</hi> becauſe to conſiſt of Matter and Form, is the Definition of <hi>Body,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:56895:135"/>4. §. The ſame Series <hi>there is</hi> in Demonſtration <hi>from Cauſe Final,</hi> in which the Subordinate is demonſtrated by the farther <hi>End</hi> until you ſhall come to the laſt in every Genus, in which the Mind acquieſces. For Example: <hi>An Animal has Lungs that it may breath, breathes that it may refreſh the Heart; the Heart is to be refreſh'd to preſerve a Temperature of Heat; a Temperature of Heat is to be kept, that the Life of the Animal may be preſerv'd,</hi> &amp;c. If theſe Demonſtrations be propos'd in <hi>Form,</hi> all, excepting the <hi>Laſt, will have a Mediate Minor;</hi> and the Laſt is the Foundation of all the reſt.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. §. It ſometimes happens that Demonſtrations from Cauſe Efficient cannot be reſolv'd into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions Mediate, unleſs the Demonſtration from <hi>Cauſe Final</hi> be commixt with the Demonſtrations <hi>from Cauſe Efficient.</hi> For Example; <hi>A Man is of a moſt Acute Touch; becauſe he is of a very thin Skin; a thin Skin, becauſe having abundance of Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Animal Spirits; abundance of thoſe Elaborated Animal Spirits, becauſe having a very large Brain,</hi> the Shop or Office of thoſe Elaborated Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <hi>Hitherto are they all Cauſes Efficient.</hi> That a Man has a very large Brain, <hi>is to be demonſtrated from the End,</hi> to wit, <hi>becauſe he ſhould reaſon;</hi> that Man ſhould reaſon again, from Cauſe Efficient <hi>to wit, becauſe he is a Rational Animal.</hi> Here now <hi>we acquieſce;</hi> becauſe the Minor is the Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Man; and therefore Immediate and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. §. <hi>Ariſtotle Cap.</hi> 10. of the <hi>fore-cited Book</hi> defines an Axiom in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> to be that which of neceſſity is true <hi>of it ſelf and of the like Neceſſity muſt</hi> ſeem ſo. <hi>Of Neceſſity true,</hi> that is, worthy of it <hi>ſelf</hi> of our Belief, or that that has no Cauſe of its Truth, by which to be demonſtrated.

The Evidence of which is ſo great, that knowing only the Signification of the Words by which they are expreſs'd, <hi>the Truth of them cannot but be apparent.</hi> For he who knows what ſignifies a Whole, and what a Part, <hi>and what to be greater,</hi> cannot be ignorant that a Whole is greater than a Part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And in this reſpect differ <hi>Axioms</hi> from <hi>Theſis's:</hi> For to the Knowledge of Theſis's, beſides the Knowledge of the Signification of Words, is <hi>requir'd the Judgment of the Senſes, and ſometimes the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of a Maſter.</hi> Of Definitions Examples may be taken <hi>out of every Diſcipline:</hi> As for Inſtance; <hi>Phyſick:</hi> As, a Body Natural is that which conſiſts of Matter and Form: <hi>Principles are thoſe which are neither made out of themſelves nor others, and out of which are made all things: Nature's the Principle and Cauſe of Motion and Quiet in that in which it is,</hi> firſt, <hi>by its ſelf, and not by Accident,</hi> &amp;c.

All which are ſuch, as, tho' they want not Demonſtration, yet are they ſuch as that out of the Signification of the Words <hi>meerly known</hi> without the Acceſſion of any thing elſe, they cannot be known <hi>to be true:</hi> For altho' any one ſhould know what's <hi>ſignify'd by the Name Body,</hi> yet can he not know by this <hi>that every Body conſiſts of Matter and Form: Nay, that there is ſuch a Thing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56895:138"/>as Natural Body, if not aſſiſted by the Help of his Senſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. §. Hence is it <hi>that Axioms ought to be held by him that would learn any Science</hi> before he comes to his Maſter. <hi>Theſes's,</hi> not, becauſe theſe are to be explained in the very <hi>Entrances</hi> of Sciences. <hi>Definitions eſpecially always;</hi> but if known by the Judgment of <hi>the Senſes, Hypotheſes,</hi> indeed, <hi>need not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. Of which that collects <hi>the Cauſe from the Effect</hi> Senſible; <hi>and this the Effect from the remote Cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. For Example; If any one riſing ſomething later than uſual, ſhould ſee the Walls of <hi>his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber colluſtrated with the Sun-Beams, and collect from thence that the Sun had been ſometime riſen; This would be from the ſenſible Effect.</hi> From the remote <hi>Cauſe,</hi> this, <hi>viz.

                  <p>And, therefore, as we collect <hi>Plants live, becauſe they grow, and are nouriſhed; ſo alſo may we that Stones do not; becauſe they neither grow, nor are nouriſhed,</hi> &amp;c. And as from <hi>an unequal Concitated Pulſe of</hi> the Arteries <hi>we collect that there is a Fever.</hi> So alſo from <hi>an equal and ſedate, that there is none; or that there is an Immunity from a Fever,</hi> &amp;c. But it does not follow that all Animals <hi>breathe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have a Senſitive Soul, altho' it does, that no Plant</hi> does, <hi>becauſe it has not; becauſe having a Senſitive Soul is not the next Cauſe of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Now of theſe two Species's of Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the firſt is much nobler than the laſt; <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it has more neceſſary Propoſitions, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of the ſame Terms of which does the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration <gap reason="foreign">

Thirdly, it is framed in the firſt Figure, <hi>and may alſo be affirmed.</hi> Whereas Demonſtration from the Cauſe remote conſiſts of <hi>leſs neceſſary Propoſitions, and not immediate; Neither does it beget Knowledge in its own kind perfect, neither can it be fram'd in the firſt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,</hi> &amp;c.

As ſoon then as the Cauſe is deprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>from the ſenſible Effect, a Compariſon is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between that Cauſe and the Effect. And when the Mind, by its Sagacity, diſcovers that that Cauſe is the Cauſe of that Effect; then a Regreſs is made from the Cauſe to the Effect, by a Demonſtration</hi>

Sometimes the <hi>Effect's perceiv'd, and Cauſe unknown;</hi> and then firſt, <hi>the Cauſe from the Effect, and then the Effect from the Cauſe is to be demonſtrated.</hi> And this ſort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration is <hi>uſually</hi> call'd by the <hi>Latins,</hi> a <hi>Regreſs,</hi> in which the Cauſes are firſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated by the Effects; And then from the true Knowledge of thoſe Cauſes <hi>is to be deriv'd a true and perfect Knowledge of thoſe Effects;</hi> whereby we not <hi>only know</hi> that the Effects <hi>be</hi> (of which our Senſes are Judges) <hi>but alſo why and what they be; further than which our Minds</hi> cannot <hi>reach.</hi> And thus much may ſuffice <hi>for an Account of true Syllogiſm.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. §. But (ſay they who wo'n't admit of the Doctrin of Fallacious Syllogiſm in Logick) the Right is the Rule both of it ſelf and the Wrong; and one Oppoſite is ſufficient to diſcern the other by. <hi>Book</hi> 1. <hi>An.</hi> Cap. 1. Whence they conclude, that <hi>the Precepts of true Syllogiſm are enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Fallacies of the other by;</hi> And ſo that this Part of Logick is nothing worth. But it <hi>is not ſo:</hi> For the Right <hi>is then the Rule of the Wrong, when the wrong,</hi> as wrong, <hi>is oppos'd to it.</hi> And the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of one Oppoſite is then ſufficient for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of the other; when the oppoſed,</hi> as oppoſed, <hi>is compoſed with it.</hi> But now when the Oblique puts on the Form <hi>of the Right,</hi> or one Oppoſite that of the other, 'tis not every ſort of Knowledge of the Right, that does ſerve to diſtinguiſh the Wrong from it; nor the one Oppoſite to underſtand the

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. SOphiſms, or Fallacies are either in Words or Things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. Of thoſe which are conſiſting in Words, <hi>there are ſix Places,</hi> viz. <hi>Homonymy, Amphiboly, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, Diviſion, Proſody or Accent, with Figure of Speech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. A Sophiſm of Homonymy <hi>is that which ariſes from the Ambiguity of one Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. <hi>This Sophiſm is ſolved by the Diſtinction of that doubtful Word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Now in Syllogiſm <hi>there are three Terms:</hi> Wherefore a Fallacy of Homonymy <hi>may three ways happen;</hi> And firſt, when the Medium's ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous; As, <hi>the End of a Thing is its Good; Death is the End of Life: And therefore Death is the Good of it.</hi> This Fallacy's ſolv'd by a <hi>Diſtinction of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56895:141"/>Word End.</hi> For End in the Major is taken for <hi>the Cauſe End;</hi> in the Minor, <hi>the Extremity of a Thing.</hi> Secondly, when the Subject is doubtful; <hi>As, Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is not a Subſtance; A Body a Quantity: And therefore a Body is not a Subſtance.</hi> This Fallacy is ſolv'd by the <hi>Diſtinction of Body:</hi> For in the Minor's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>a Body Mathematical;</hi> in the Concluſion, <hi>Phyſical.</hi> In the third Place we <hi>lay a Sophiſm of Homonymy,</hi> when the Predicate is ambiguous; <hi>As, That which is round has no Beginning nor End; The World is round; and therefore has no Beginning nor End:</hi> This Sophiſm is ſolved <hi>by diſtinguiſhing Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and End:</hi> For in the Major are underſtood Beginning and End of <hi>Magnitude;</hi> in the Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>of Time,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hither may be referr'd thoſe captious Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Have you left off to commit Adultery? Have you found that you never loſt?</hi> &amp;c. For whether you af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or deny, <hi>you'll be catch'd by Homonymy.</hi> For if you ſay you have left off to commit Adultery, you confeſs that ſometimes you have committed it: becauſe we have <hi>ſometime done that which we ceaſe to do.</hi> But if you ſay you have not, the Sophiſter will reply then, you ſtill continue in it. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if you affirm you have that which you have not loſt, the Sophiſter'll reply that then you have Horns; <hi>becauſe you have not loſt them:</hi> And if the <hi>Contrary,</hi> you have not Eyes; <hi>becauſe you have not loſt them.</hi> Wherefore you are to ſay, that the Word <hi>not to leave off</hi> is Ambiguous: For when one is ſaid <hi>to leave off who has done any thing, and does it no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> the Word not to leave off <hi>may be taken either for not to have done it; or for perſiſting ſtill to do it:</hi> And <hi>therefore</hi> he may be ſaid not to have left off both, <hi>who never did it, and who ſtill continues in it.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe any one may be ſaid not to have <hi>loſt,</hi> both that which he <hi>never had,</hi> as Horns; and that which <hi>he yet has</hi> as his Eyes: For he is ſaid <hi>to have loſt,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56895:141"/>who once had a thing, and now has it not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>See</hi> A. Gel. Lib. 16. Noct. At. C. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. Sophiſm of Amphiboly's that which ariſes from the Ambiguous Senſe of a Speech whoſe particular Words have no Homonymy by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. And this Sophiſm is ſolv'd by the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Ambiguous Speech.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Fallacy of Amphiboly is laid two Ways; Firſt, when the very Syntax of the Speech is Ambiguous; as, <hi>Quod quiſquam vidit, id ipſum vidit,</hi> that is, <hi>What any one ſees, that</hi> he would have <hi>it ſelf ſees. Some one ſees a Tree; and therefore the Tree it ſelf ſees.</hi> This Fallacy's <hi>ſolv'd</hi> by the Diſtinction of the Ambiguous Speech, <hi>viz. id ipſum vidit;</hi> For that it ſelf may be either of the Nominative Caſe, and then the Major'll <hi>be falſe;</hi> or the Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſative, and then, <hi>indeed,</hi> the Major'll <hi>be true:</hi> But yet thence this Concluſion will not follow, <hi>viz. And therefore the Tree it ſelf ſees;</hi> Becauſe the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm <hi>then</hi> would have four Terms. Of the ſame kind likewiſe is this Catch; Thoſe <hi>qui ſunt ſui Magiſtri;</hi> that is, are their own Maſters, are at their own Diſpoſe: Servants <hi>ſunt Magiſtri ſui;</hi> that is, are their own Maſters: And therefore Servants <hi>are at their own Dipoſe:</hi> For the Ambiguity in the <hi>Latin,</hi> is in the Words <hi>Magiſtri ſui,</hi> their Maſters; which in the Major, <hi>are of the Plural,</hi> and Minor of the <hi>Singular Number.</hi> The like Ambiguity's in theſe Enunciations, <hi>viz. Socrus oderunt Nurus; Aio te Aeacida Romanos vincere poſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Fallacy of Amphiboly's then made when the very kind or Phraſe of the Speech begets Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity or Uncertainty of Opinion: As, <hi>He that ſends a Book into the Light, would have it read of all Men: He that throws it into the Fire, ſends it into the Light; And therefore he that throws it into the Fire, would have it read of all Men.</hi> This Fallacy's ſolv'd by the Diſtinction of the Phraſe, <hi>ſending into
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56895:142"/>the Light,</hi> which in the <hi>Major Propoſition</hi> ſignifies to <hi>Publiſh,</hi> in the Minor <hi>to burn.</hi> Such is the Caption of thoſe who would infer from hence the Invocation of the Dead; becauſe the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> in bleſſing his Poſterity when ſpeaking of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Children, <hi>amongſt the reſt, ſays thus,</hi> Gen. 48.16. <hi>And my Name ſhall be call'd upon theſe Children, and the Name of my Fathers,</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Iſaac. For the calling of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Name upon the Children of <hi>Joſeph</hi> by an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Idiotiſm,</hi> is no more than the calling them <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> from the Name of <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax,</hi> 7. A Sophiſm of Compoſition is that which ariſes from a Compoſition of thoſe things which are to be divided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. Of Diviſion, on the Contrary, from the Diviſion of thoſe things which are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. To be ſolved by a Diſtinction of the divers Senſes which a Speech <hi>has</hi> according to the different Compoſition or Diviſion of its Parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. Many things when divided, <hi>are true,</hi> which joyn'd, <hi>are falſe;</hi> As, that <hi>One ſitting may ſtand;</hi> Many, on the other hand, <hi>true conjoyn'd, which are falſe divided;</hi> As, <hi>All Penitent Sinners ſhall be ſav'd.</hi> When the Argument runs from divided to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd, <hi>there follows a Fallacy of the Compoſition;</hi> when from conjoyn'd to divided, <hi>of the Diviſion.</hi> Each of theſe <hi>Fallacies</hi> may be committed <hi>Eight Ways.</hi> Firſt, in Enunciations Modal; As, <hi>'Tis poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for one ſitting, to ſtand.</hi> For if the Participle <hi>Sitting</hi> be joyn'd with the Verb <hi>Stand, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation is falſe,</hi> if joyn'd with the Mode Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>true.</hi> For one <hi>ſitting,</hi> even while he ſits, has the Power or Faculty of <hi>ſtanding; but not of ſtanding as long as he ſits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>In Enumerations,</hi> whoſe Parts are conjoyn'd or ſeparated by ſome Grammatical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction; As, <hi>Every Animal either is Rational or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56895:142"/>Irrational: But not every Animal is Rational: And therefore every Animal Irrational.</hi> Here the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Major <hi>cauſes the Fallacy.</hi> For the Major's true, if taken conjoyntly, and as a ſimple Enunciation whoſe Attribute Rational or Irrational is taken, as, <hi>unum quid, or one ſomething.</hi> But if taken dividedly, and as an Enunciation Compoſed, in this Manner: <hi>Every Animal is Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal, or every Animal is Irrational; apparently falſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, When in the Major the Note of Quantities taken <hi>Collectively or Diſtributively into the Genus's of the Singulars:</hi> It is ſo uſed as if it were <hi>taken Diſtributively into the Singulars of thoſe Genus's;</hi> As, <hi>All the Planets are Seven: The Sun and Moon are Planets; And therefore the Sun and Moon are Seven.</hi> This Fallacy conſiſts in the Word <hi>All,</hi> which if <hi>Collectively taken,</hi> the Major <hi>indeed</hi> will <hi>be true,</hi> but the Minor <hi>falſe.</hi> For this ought to have been the Minor; <hi>The Sun and Moon are all the Planets.</hi> If the Word All is taken <hi>Diſtributively, the Major will be falſe.</hi> Another; <hi>Every Animal was in</hi> Noah<hi>'s Ark; Many Animals periſh'd in the Flood: Therefore many Animal, periſh'd in the Flood, were in</hi> Noah<hi>'s Ark.</hi> This Fallacy alſo lies in the <hi>Word Every,</hi> which, if taken of the Singulars of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's the <hi>Major</hi> will be falſe; if of the Genus's of the Singulars, <hi>the Minor.</hi> For none of the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus's of thoſe Animals periſh'd which are ſaid to have been in</hi> Noah<hi>'s</hi> Ark.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Fourthly, when any Word may be conjoyn'd either <hi>to the Antecedents or Conſequents;</hi> As, that of <hi>Menander, Te Servum feci liberum;</hi> that is, I made thee a Servant a Freeman; which may <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,</hi> I brought thee into Servitude, who wer't <hi>free;</hi> or, I made thee, being a Servant, <hi>a Freeman;</hi> that is, <hi>Maumiſed thee, or ſet the free from Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:56895:143"/>5. Fifthly, <hi>When a Place is quoted out of any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and ſome Part of it concealed.</hi> With this Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy the Devil, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. attempted to perſuade Chriſt, that he ſhould throw himſelf down from the Pinacles of the Temple, bringing in a Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from <hi>David, after this manner;</hi> It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>ſays he, He ſhall give his Angels Charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee; and they ſhall bear thee in their Hands, leſt at any time thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stones</hi> But it it is written, <hi>he ſhall give his Angels Charge concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee, to keep thee walking in all thy Ways:</hi> that is, following the Buſineſs of thy Calling, <hi>with both Hands ſhall they bear thee up that thou daſh not thy Foot againſt a Stone,</hi> Pſalm 92.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When a Word is now taken in a Divided; Now Conjoyned Senſe: As, <hi>Every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curia</hi> or Neglect, <hi>is worthy to be blamed; The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate is in Curiâ;</hi> that is, in Court: <hi>And therefore the Senate is worthy to be blamed.</hi> This Fallacy rather has Place in <hi>Speech than Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. Seventhly, When what's ſaid of the Parts is concluded of the Whole; or what of the Whole of the Parts; <hi>as Two and Three, are Even and Odd. Five are Two and Three: Five thertfore are even and odd.</hi> This is a Fallacy of Compoſition. <hi>Five are One Number; Two and Three are Five: Therefore Two and Three are One Number.</hi> This is of Diviſion.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Eightly, When thoſe things <hi>are conjoyned</hi> which <hi>are ſeverally predicated, or divided, which are joyntly:</hi> As, <hi>This Dog is a Father: This Dog is thine: And therefore this Dog is thy Father.</hi> This is a Fallacy of the Compoſition. <hi>Again,</hi> Mycillus <hi>is a good Shooemaker; And therefore</hi> Mycillus <hi>is a good Man.</hi> This is of Diviſion. This Fallacy <hi>alſo</hi> may be reduc'd to that of, from <hi>a Word ſimply to one</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum quid, <hi>or according to ſomething or its Contrary.</hi> For nothing hinders, but that ſeveral Cauſes of Fallacy may concur to <hi>the ſame Catch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:56895:143"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. The Sophiſm of Accident or Proſody, is that which riſes from the Way of Writing or Pronouncing any thing: <hi>Either differently wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe things which are Pronounced after the ſame Manner, or differently pronouncing thoſe which are alike written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. And this Sophiſm is ſolv'd either by ſhewing that thoſe things which are the ſame Manner <hi>pronounc'd are differently written or</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently <hi>pronounc'd, which are in the ſame Manner written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Word Proſody or Accent, <hi>here</hi> is <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally</hi> taken for every Variation of the Voice. The Captions of this Place are of two kinds, as appears from the Definitions propoſed. Of the Firſt, <hi>thoſe in which the Difference of Writings, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by a Similitude of Pronunciation.</hi> And that's done three manner of Ways. For either thoſe Words are pronounced after the ſame manner, <hi>which differ in Letters, or Aſpiration, or Notes of the Accents.</hi> For Example; <hi>Omnis Equus,</hi> every <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus,</hi> that is, <hi>Horſe, is a Beaſt: Every juſt Man is Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus,</hi> that is, Righteous; <hi>Therefore every juſt Man is Beaſt.</hi> This Catch is in the Letter. Moreover, <hi>Every Ara,</hi> that is, Altar, is <hi>in the Temple; A Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Hogs is named</hi> Hara, that is, Sty; <hi>And therefore a Stable of Hogs is in the Temple.</hi> This conſiſts in the Aſpiration; for <hi>in the Greek</hi> the Words are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten otherwiſe, both alike. Laſtly, If one confound the Verb <hi>amare, to love,</hi> with the Adverb of that Name, which ſignifies <hi>bitterly,</hi> the Caption ſhall be from the Note of the Accent. Theſe Captions were uſual after Aſpirations and Notes of Accents began to be written <hi>over their Words,</hi> But before theſe Captions belonged to the ſecond Genus.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Which are committed <hi>two manner of Ways:</hi> And firſt, when we take that in earneſt which is Ironically written: Or on the Contrary; <hi>As, If
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56895:144"/>a Servant ſhould think himſelf commended by his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Maſter, writing to him after this manner: Ha, Good Sir, You have taken Care very fairly.</hi> Or the like. Secondly, when Words which have their Antepenultima <hi>or laſt Syllable but one,</hi> long, <hi>ſhould be taken as if ſhort;</hi> As, if any one ſhould confound the Word <hi>Leporem, a Hare, with the Word Lepôrem, Facetiouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 12. Sophiſm from the Figure of Speech, is <hi>then, when from the Likeneſs of Words it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that they have the ſame Accidents or Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. This is ſolved by ſhewing the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Accidents or Signification <hi>in the Words alike.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. §. As, <hi>If any one ſhould collect Poeta,</hi> a Poet, <hi>to be of the Feminine Gender; becauſe Nota is ſo; or Glycerium Neuter, becauſe Delirium:</hi> Or that <hi>Urere to burn, Verberare,</hi> to beat; <hi>Movere,</hi> to move, <hi>are Actions;</hi> And therefore <hi>Ardere, Vapulare muſt be ſo.</hi> Or that <hi>Ingratitnde</hi> ſignifies a Quality: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo <hi>muſt Longitude,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 1. OF the Sophiſms in Things, <hi>there are ſeven Places,</hi> viz. <hi>Accident, a Word ſimply ſpoken and according to ſomething, Ignorance of the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lench, <hi>Conſequent, Begging of the Queſtion, Not Cauſe for the Cauſe, and manifold Interrogation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 2. Accident, <hi>is then, when we collect that to agree to the Subject which was ſaid of the Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 3. And this is ſolv'd, by ſhewing that that which is gathered of the Subject, <hi>is only ſaid of the Predicate by Accident; or that the Predicate it ſelf, is Accidentally ſaid of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. And thus a Catch of the Accident is laid <hi>for us two manner of Ways;</hi> And <hi>firſt</hi> when any thing's ſaid of the Attribute by Accident, <hi>as this; Man is a Species; Socrates is a Man: And therefore he's a Species.</hi> This Fallacy conſiſts in this, <hi>viz. in that to be a Species is ſaid of Man by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; But To be a Man, of Socrates by himſelf.</hi> The other is, when the Attribute it ſelf, is ſaid of the Subject by Accident; <hi>As here; The Mouſe gnaws
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56895:145"/>Cheeſe; Mouſe is a Syllable: And therefore a Syllable gnaws Cheeſe.</hi> This Fallacy is, becauſe to gnaw Cheeſe, is ſaid of the Mouſe <hi>by it ſelf; to be a Syllable, by Accident,</hi> and Cauſe of its Name. <hi>Both Ways</hi> the Fallacy ariſes, out of the Acceptation of the Word chang'd, <hi>or Genus of Suppoſition,</hi> as the Schoolmen call it. For Man in the Major is taken <hi>in a Simple;</hi> Minor, <hi>a Concrete Acceptation;</hi> and Mouſe in the <hi>Major,</hi> is taken <hi>Formally,</hi> or for the thing ſignify'd; <hi>and in the Minor,</hi> Materially, <hi>or for the Word only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 4. That from <hi>the Thing ſimply ſaid,</hi> is <hi>then,</hi> when from ſomething that is ſimply true, we collect <hi>another that is true only in ſome reſpect,</hi> or according to ſomething. On the Contrary, That, <hi>in ſome Reſpect,</hi> is, <hi>then, when from that which is partially true,</hi> or, according to ſome reſpect, <hi>we collect that any thing is ſimply ſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. This is ſolv'd by ſhewing the Difference between that which is <hi>ſpoken ſimply, and that in ſome Reſpect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. A ſimply ſaid is that, whoſe Predicate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Subject <hi>in every Reſpect, Part, Time and Place without any Limitation.</hi> That according to ſomething, in ſome Reſpect, Part, Time, Place only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Examples of the firſt kind are theſe, <hi>viz. The Right-Hand is not to be cut off: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not then, when it is invaded by a Gangrene. The Man is Mortal; And therefore ſo as to his Soul. The Pledge ought to be reſtored to its Owner when he requires it; And therefore a Sword, altho' he be Mad when he requires it,</hi> &amp;c. From that according to ſome Relation theſe, <hi>viz. Man's Soul is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal: And therefore the Man. Wine hurts a Man in a Fever: And therefore in general.</hi> Mycillus <hi>is a good Shoemaker; And therefore he is good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 6. Sophiſm from the Ignorance of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lench, is that, <hi>when the Concluſion ſeems to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Proof of the Reſpondent, and yet does
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56895:145"/>not contradict it, by reaſon of ſome Condition's being Wanting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 7. And this is ſolved by ſhewing what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is omitted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. We have <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. affirmed an Elench to be a Syllogiſm with a Contradiction, and <hi>Cap.</hi> 22. <hi>of the Firſt Book we entreated of the Conditions of Contradiction.</hi> But altho' every Sophiſm offends by Ignorance of the Elench (for every Sophiſm ſeems to be an Elench, and yet is not ſo) yet here that eſpecially is ſo called in which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is oppoſed to another's Aſſertion, and yet ſome Condition or other is <hi>wanting</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a legitimate Contradiction. For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <hi>If one going about to prove, that Chriſt was not</hi> David<hi>'s Lord, ſhould conclude that he was his Son, he miſtakes by an Ignorance of the Elench;</hi> that is, an Ignorance of the Caſe and the true Senſe wherein the Reſpondent were to be taken, and Laws of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: For Lord and Son are Oppoſites, if they are attribted to <hi>any One in the ſame Reſpect.</hi> But theſe are not attributed <hi>to Chriſt in the ſame Reſpect, but in a Diverſe.</hi> For he was <hi>David's Lord as to his</hi> Divine, and Son, <hi>as to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 8. Sophiſm of Conſequent is <hi>then, when One Enunciation is inferr'd from another, from the which it does not follow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 9. And this is ſolv'd by citing of the Rule againſt which ſuch Inference does of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. There are <hi>Four Rules</hi> which are to be obſerved in the Inferring of a Conſequent from an Antecedent, of which if we <hi>break but One,</hi> the Conſequent <hi>will be Null;</hi> and if ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference <hi>be admitted,</hi> there will be <hi>then a Caption or Fallacy of the Conſequent.</hi> And the firſt of theſe is, <hi>The Univerſal Affirming muſt never be ſimply converted:</hi> And therefore if any Man
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56895:146"/>ſhould conclude <hi>thus,</hi> viz. <hi>Becauſe every Flatterer is Complaiſant; Therefore every Complaiſant is a Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer; he would be deceiv'd by a Fallacy of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.</hi> And the ſecond Rule is, <hi>that from a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Affirming a Univerſal Denying, can't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded otherwiſe than by Contrapoſition.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if any one ſhould conclude thus, <hi>viz. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is begotten, has a Beginning: And therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not, has not;</hi> as the Humane Soul, the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One ſhould commit a Fallacy of the Conſequent: For thus one ſhould have inferr'd, <hi>viz. That that which has not a Beginning is not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and ſo it is a Converſion by Contrapoſition.</hi> The Third is, <hi>The Minor muſt not be denyed in the firſt Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;</hi> Or, which returns to the ſame Account, <hi>viz.</hi> From <hi>the Remotion of the Antecedent can't be inferr'd that of the Conſequent,</hi> as we obſerv'd Chapter the 12th in that Part relating to Hypothetical Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm. The Fourth is, <hi>That One of the Premiſſes muſt be denyed in the Second Figure;</hi> Or, which is the ſame thing, <hi>the Poſition of the Antecedent ought not to be concluded from that of the Conſequent,</hi> as we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd again in the ſame Chapter; And therefore theſe ſorts of Syllogiſms will be Paralogiſms, <hi>viz. Every Man is an Animal; A Horſe is not a Man: And therefore not an Animal.</hi> Or thus, <hi>If a Horſe be a Man, he is an Animal: But a Horſe is not a Man; And therefore not an Animal,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Flatterer is Complaiſant; Such an One is Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: And therefore ſuch an One is a Flatterer.</hi> Or thus, <hi>If</hi> Criſpus <hi>be a Flatterer, he is Complaiſant; But he is Complaiſant; And therefore a Flatterer,</hi> &amp;c. If any one be deceiv'd by theſe ſorts of Argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, <hi>either from himſelf or others;</hi> as it <hi>often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens;</hi> he is then deceiv'd by a <hi>Fallacy of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But becauſe the Fault of a <hi>falſe Conſequence</hi> is eaſily diſcernible, in theſe ſorts of Syllogiſms, Sophiſters uſually conceal it, either by ſuppreſſing
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56895:146"/>one of the Premiſſes; <hi>As,</hi> Criſpus <hi>is Complaiſant; And therefore a Flatterer: Walks by Night; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Thief.</hi> Or elſe by Circumlocution; <hi>As, he that ſays you are an Animal, ſays true: He that ſays you are an Aſs, ſays you are an Animal: And therefore he that ſays you are an Aſs, ſays true.</hi> For this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumentation is juſt as if one ſhould lay down this Poſition, <hi>viz. You are an Animal: An Aſs is an Animal: And therefore you are an Aſs.</hi> Which is an Argumentation contrary to Rule, <hi>Of two Affirmatives in the ſecond Figure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. Which is ſolv'd by ſhewing that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium is not diverſe from the Queſtion, or at leaſt more known than it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 10. The Sophiſm of Begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>is then, when any thing is proved, either by it ſelf or ſomething that is equally unknown with it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. This is call'd a Begging of the Principle becauſe it is, a Begging of <hi>that which in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was ſought for.</hi> Theſe Sort of Catches may be two ways laid: And Firſt, <hi>when the ſame thing is prov'd by it ſelf. Secondly, when one unknown thing is proved by another that is equally unknown with it ſelf.</hi> The ſame thing is ſaid to be prov'd by it ſelf; when the Subject or Predicate of the Queſtion, <hi>the Name being chang'd,</hi> is brought in for a Medium, to prove the Queſtion; As, if any one ſhould prove the <hi>Soul of Man to be ex Traduce,</hi> Engliſh, <hi>of the Seed of the Parent, becauſe begotten by the Seed of the Parent.</hi> I ſay, the Subject or Predicate, <hi>changing the Name:</hi> For, <hi>if the Name were not changed,</hi> the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation would be <hi>mere Child's Play.</hi> And yet for all this, every Argumentation in which the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um is the ſame with the Subject or Predicate of the Queſtion is not to be rejected as a Sophiſm, but <hi>only that</hi> whoſe Medium is not only <hi>in it ſelf and of its own Nature the ſame with the Queſtion; but alſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56895:147"/>as to us;</hi> as, <hi>in that</hi> which we propoſed above. But if the Medium be of its own Nature, the <hi>ſame as the Queſtion, but not</hi> alſo <hi>as to us; or our Manner of Concetpion,</hi> the Argumentation <hi>is not to be rejected:</hi> Unleſs you can ſuppoſe all the Arguments which are fetch'd from <hi>Eſſential Places; As, Genus, Species, Definition, Whole and Part, to make Captious Argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, The ſecond Way is <hi>when the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um's as much unknown as the Queſtion it ſelf;</hi> As, if one ſhould prove <hi>Viſion to be made by Emiſſion, becauſe not by Reception.</hi> Now this Sophiſm tends to this; Partly, that the Sophiſter may ſeem to abound with Arguments; partly, that changing the Forms of the Words, he may <hi>conciliate</hi> a <hi>Shew of Probability to his Declarations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 11. Sophiſm of not Cauſe for the Cauſe is then, when that which is not the Cauſe, <hi>or by Accident is obtruded for the true Cauſe, and that by it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 12. And this Sophiſm is ſolv'd by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of the <hi>true Cauſe upon which the Effect by it ſelf depends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. The Caption of not Cauſe for the Cauſe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lies in a Syllogiſm that leads to Inconvenience or direct. In a Syllogiſm that leads to Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when the Falſity of the Concluſion brought, is imputed to one of the Premiſſes, which is not the Cauſe of it; As, <hi>if one deſigning to prove the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Soul Mortal, ſhould thus argue: Every Immortal is Eternal; The Soul of Man is Immortal: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul of Man is Eternal.</hi> But this Concluſion is falſe, and the Occaſion of it was in the Minor, which was <hi>that the Soul of Man was Immortal; And therefore Mortal.</hi> For this Argumentation is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſm of the not Cauſe for the Cauſe. For he ſays, <hi>that this Propoſition, The Soul is Immortal, is the Cauſe of a falſe Concluſion;</hi> when it was that, <hi>viz. That every Immortal is Eternal.</hi> In a Syllogiſm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56895:147"/>when that which is attributed to the Cauſe by Accident, happens not, but to the Cauſes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; <hi>As, Religion excites Civil Wars. From the Reading of the Sacred Scriptures ſpring Hreſies. Wine is heady and intoxicates,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And therefore Religion, Reading of the Sacred Scriptures, and Wine are not to be tolerated in any Common-Wealth, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 13. The Sophiſm of many Interrogations, is <hi>then, when two or more Queſtions are ſo propoſed, as that they ſhew only but as One.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 14. And theſe ſorts of Sophiſms are <hi>brought about two manner of Ways:</hi> And firſt, when two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or two Predicates, or perhaps more, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded under <hi>ſo many diſtinct ſort of Names; as, is the World, Eternal and Perfect,</hi> &amp;c. This is a Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Interrogation: For if you <hi>anſwer Affirmatively,</hi> the Sophiſter will ſet upon you as if you had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>that the World was Eternal;</hi> and if otherwiſe, he excepts againſt you; as if you <hi>deny'd that the World was perfect.</hi> And, ſecondly, you may make a Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of many Interrogations in one Word; <hi>As, Deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Have you left off to commit Adultery? Have you loſt your Horns,</hi> &amp;c. But enough of this is ſaid in the Place of Homonymy.</p>
                  <p>And thus much may ſuffice for Syllogiſm. The <hi>Laſt of the Four Inſtruments is that which now demands our Attendance; And that is</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod. Of which we ſhall entreat in the following Chapter.</p>

                     <hi>Ax.</hi> 5. In which we muſt obſerve in the firſt Place, that all the Parts are to be <hi>Homogene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi> that is, <hi>not Impertinent, or Foreign to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. §. By which Means, we not only confirm that Rule, that Diſciplines ought not to be mixed: <hi>So as in Mathematicks we are not to uſe Ethical Demonſtrations: Or in Ethicks, Mathematical,</hi> &amp;c. But this alſo, <hi>viz. That every thing ought to be ſet in its proper Place;</hi> And ſo thoſe things which are reciprocated <hi>with the Genus to the Genus; and with the Species to the Species, ſhould be attributed:</hi> And that all things be Reciprocal as much as may be.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56895:148"/>2. §. And indeed this Rule is to be obſerv'd in the very Precepts which belong to the Eſſence of Diſciplines; But yet in the Comments where the Precepts of them are explain'd, and confirm'd, the Obſervation <hi>of it is not ſo Neceſſary:</hi> For it often happens to the Maſter teaching Phyſick, that he is forc'd to fetch from Logick, and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks, Phyſick. Moreover in Divinity and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diſciplines, how much of Neceſſity muſt they fetch from Philoſophy for the explaining their Controverſies, which yet becomes no Part at all of thoſe Diſciplines?
